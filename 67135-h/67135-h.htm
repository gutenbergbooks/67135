<p class="h2sub">Born 1771.&mdash;Died 1806.</p>

<p>This enterprising and distinguished traveller was
born on the 10th of September, 1771, at Fowlshiels,
a farm occupied by his father on the banks of the
Yarrow, near Selkirk. In common with the greater
number of the sons of Scottish yeomen, Mungo Park,
notwithstanding that the number of his brothers and
sisters amounted to no less than thirteen, received
a respectable education, and at the age of fifteen
was bound apprentice to a surgeon at Selkirk. At
the close of this apprenticeship, in 1789, Park continued
his medical studies at the university of Edinburgh,
where, though nothing remarkable is recorded
of him, he seems to have applied with great
assiduity to his professional studies. His summer
vacations, during one of which he made a tour to
the Highlands, were devoted to botany.</p>

<p>Having completed his education, Park removed
to London in search of professional employment.
Here, through the kindness of Mr. Dickson, his
brother-in-law, he had the good fortune to become
known to Sir Joseph Banks, to whom so many other
distinguished travellers have been indebted; and
through whose recommendation he was appointed
surgeon to the Worcester East Indiaman. In this
capacity he made a voyage to Bencoolen, in Sumatra,
the only fruits of which was a paper containing
descriptions of eight new fishes from Sumatra,
published in the third volume of the <i>Linnæan
Transactions</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after his return from this voyage, Park,
learning that the African Association, of which his
friend Sir Joseph Banks was a very active and zealous
member, were desirous of engaging a person to
replace Major Houghton, who, it was feared, had
fallen a sacrifice to the climate, or perished in some
contest with the natives, eagerly offered his services,
which after due deliberation were accepted. The
association, he observes, conducted itself with great
liberality towards him. He forthwith prepared himself
for the voyage, and on the 22d of May, 1795,
sailed from Portsmouth in the brig Endeavour. His
instructions, he says, were very plain and concise.
He was directed, on his arrival in Africa, “to pass
on to the river Niger, either by the way of Bambouk
or by such other route as should be found most convenient;
that I should ascertain the course, and, if
possible, the rise and termination of the river. That
I should use my utmost exertions to visit the principal
towns or cities in its neighbourhood, particularly
Timbuctoo and Houssa; and that I should afterward
be at liberty to return to Europe, either by the
way of the Gambia, or by such other route as under
all the then existing circumstances of my situation
and prospects should appear to me to be most
advisable.”</p>

<p>On the 21st of June, after an agreeable voyage of
thirty days, he arrived at Jillifica, a town on the
northern bank of the Gambia, in the kingdom of
Barra. From this place after a stay of two days he
proceeded up the Gambia, in the waters of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
were found prodigious numbers of fish of unknown
species, together with alligators and hippopotami,
whose teeth furnish excellent ivory. Park, having
quitted the Endeavour at Jonkakonda, proceeded
thence by land; and reaching Pisania, a small British
factory in the King of Yam’s dominions, on the 5th
of July took up his residence at the house of Dr.
Laidley, until he should be able to prosecute his
journey into the interior.</p>

<p>Our traveller’s first care now was to render himself
master of the Mandingo language, which in this
part of Africa is in general use; and to collect from
every source within his power information respecting
the countries he was about to visit. In the language
his progress depended on his own application;
but he soon found that little or no reliance could be
placed on the accounts of the interior furnished him
by the natives, who on the most material points
were frequently in direct contradiction with each
other. His anxiety to examine and judge for himself
was therefore increased. However, besides
that the rainy season, which had now commenced,
rendered travelling impracticable, another equally
insuperable bar to the speedy prosecution of his
journey quickly presented itself. In observing on
the 31st of July an eclipse of the moon, he imprudently
exposed himself to the night dew, and next
day he found himself attacked by fever and delirium,
which were the commencement of an illness that
with a very trifling intermission confined him during
two months within doors. “The care and attention
of Dr. Laidley contributed greatly,” says Park, “to
alleviate my sufferings; his company and conversation
beguiled the tedious hours during that gloomy
season when the rain falls in torrents; when suffocating
heats oppress by day, and when the night is
spent by the terrified traveller in listening to the
croaking of frogs (of which the numbers are beyond
imagination), the shrill cry of the jackal, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
deep howling of the hyena; a dismal concert, interrupted
only by the roar of such tremendous thunder
as no person can form a conception of but those who
have heard it.”</p>

<p>Having been disappointed in his expectations of
proceeding with a slave caravan towards Bambarra,
Park departed from Pisania on the 2d of December,
1795. He had been provided with a negro servant,
named Johnson, who had been many years in Great
Britain, and understood both the English and Mandingo
languages; and with a negro boy, named
Demba, the property of Dr. Laidley, who, as the
highest inducement of good behaviour, promised him
his freedom on his return. Besides these Park was
accompanied by four other persons, who, though independent
of his control, were made to understand
that their safe return to the countries on the Gambia
would depend on our traveller’s preservation.
His equipment was by no means magnificent: a
horse for himself, two asses for his servants, provisions
for two days, a small assortment of beads,
amber, and tobacco, a few changes of linen and
other apparel, an umbrella, a pocket sextant, a magnetic
compass, a thermometer, two fowling-pieces,
two pair of pistols, and some other small articles.
His friends at Pisania accompanied him during the
first two days, and then, dismissing him on his way,
took their leave, secretly persuaded they should
never see him more.</p>

<p>He had scarcely lost sight of his European friends,
and ridden off musing and somewhat melancholy
into the wood, when a body of black people presented
themselves in a clamorous manner before
him, demanding custom-dues, in default of which
they threatened to carry him before their king. To
escape from this honour, which might have proved
a costly one, Park presented them with a little
tobacco, upon which they were of course contented,
and he was allowed to proceed. On reaching Medina,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the capital of Woolli, he judged it prudent, or
perhaps absolutely necessary, to present himself at
the king’s levee, when the venerable benevolent old
chief not only granted him permission to traverse
his dominions, but assured him he would offer up
prayers for his safety, partly to secure which he furnished
him with a trusty guide.</p>

<p>Having safely reached the frontiers of the Woolli
dominions, Park dismissed his guide; and being
about to enter a country interspersed with deserts,
in which water is frequently not to be procured, he
hired three negroes, experienced elephant-hunters,
who were at once to serve as guides and water-bearers.
While he was preparing to depart, however,
one of these negroes, who had all received a
part of their pay in advance, made his escape; and
lest the remaining two should be disposed to follow
his example, he immediately gave orders to fill their
calabashes, or gourds, with water, and struck off into
the wilderness, just as the sun was appearing above
the horizon. Through this desert they proceeded
until they reached Tallika, the frontier town of Bondou
towards Woolli, where Park engaged a kind of
custom-house officer to accompany him for a trifling
present to Fatteconda, the residence of the king.
In his company our traveller accordingly performed
the journey to that city. On his arrival at Fatteconda
he was received by the black chief with much
apparent kindness, though Major Houghton, he had
heard, in his passage through the country, had been
both insulted and plundered by this same man.
However, he soon discovered that the manifestations
of a hospitable disposition observable in the
king’s manner was not deceptive. It is true he was
so completely captivated by our traveller’s best blue
coat and gilt buttons, that he could not resist the
temptation to beg it; but he endeavoured in some
measure to remunerate him for the loss by a present
of five drachms of gold, and by altogether abstaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
from examining his baggage, or exacting any other
present than what was voluntarily bestowed.</p>

<p>The territories of these petty African chiefs, whom
we complaisantly denominate kings, are exceedingly
limited in extent. Your road conducts you to-day
through one kingdom, to-morrow through another,
and the next day through a third; which, of all those
circumstances that obstruct the movements of the
traveller in Africa, is, perhaps, the most vexatious
and the most difficult to overcome; as the rapacity
of the first chiefs who lie in his way deprives him
of the power of satisfying the equal rapacity of the
remainder. This consideration alone would suffice
to convince me that if ever Africa is to be properly
explored, it must be by an armed force sufficiently
powerful to carry terror through the country, and
not by a solitary traveller, who, whatever may be
his perseverance or courage, must either fall in the
attempt, or return with notions hastily formed,
picked up at random, or borrowed from the ignorant
credulous natives. The perpetual state of captivity
in which Park moved is a strong proof of this. He
was never, unless when far removed from human
society by woods or deserts, completely master of
his own actions, or sufficiently respected to render
it possible for him to contemplate the superior
classes, even of these savages, from a proper level.
To judge with impartiality, a man must neither be
under the influence of fear nor of contempt, of anger
nor of gratitude. He must feel himself perfectly on
a level with those about him.</p>

<p>To proceed, however, with Park:&mdash;“In the afternoon,”
says he, “my fellow-travellers informed me,
that as this was the boundary between Bondou and
Kajaaga, and dangerous for travellers, it would be
necessary to continue our journey by night, until we
should reach a more hospitable part of the country.
I agreed to the proposal, and hired two people for
guides through the woods, and as soon as the people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
of the village were gone to sleep (the moon shining
bright) we set out. The stillness of the air, the
howling of the wild beasts, and the deep solitude of
the forest made the scene solemn and impressive.
Not a word was uttered by any of us but in a whisper;
all were attentive, and every one anxious to
show his sagacity by pointing out to me the wolves
and hyenas as they glided like shadows from one
thicket to another. Towards morning we arrived
at a village called Kimmoo, when our guides awakened
one of their acquaintance, and we stopped to
give our asses some corn, and roast a few ground-nuts
for ourselves. At daylight we resumed our
journey, and in the afternoon arrived at Joag in the
kingdom of Kajaaga.”</p>

<p>On arriving at Joag, the frontier town of the kingdom
of Kajaaga, our traveller (who had taken up his
residence at the house of the dooty, or chief man
of the town, a rigid but hospitable Mohammedan)
was favoured with an opportunity of observing the
genuine character of the negro. “The same evening,”
says he, “Madiboo, the bushreen who had accompanied
me from Pisania, went to pay a visit to
his father and mother, who dwelt at a neighbouring
town called Dramanet. He was joined by my other
attendant the blacksmith; and as soon as it was
dark, I was invited to see the sports of the inhabitants,
it being their custom on the arrival of strangers
to welcome them by diversions of different kinds.
I found a great crowd surrounding a party who were
dancing by the light of some large fires to the music
of four drums, which were beat with great exactness
and uniformity. The dances, however, consisted
more in wanton gestures than in muscular exertion
or graceful attitudes. The ladies vied with each
other in displaying the most voluptuous movements
imaginable.”</p>

<p>At Joag, while preparing to advance on his journey,
he was suddenly honoured with a visit from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
king’s son, accompanied by a troop of horse, who,
pretending that by entering his father’s dominions
he had forfeited the whole of his property, insisted
upon examining his merchandise, of which he seized
upon the moiety. Of the remnant that remained,
particularly a little amber and a few beads, which
he had succeeded in concealing, he was now so
fearful of producing any portion, even for the purchase
of food, lest he should once more awaken the
cupidity of the authorities, that both he and his attendants
determined on combating hunger for the
day, “and wait some opportunity of purchasing or
begging provisions.” In this extremity, while he
was sitting down chewing straws, a female slave,
who observed him in passing by, was moved with
compassion, and presented him with a quantity of
ground-nuts, which was a very seasonable supply.
Scarcely had the old woman left him, before he received
information that the nephew of the King of
Kasson, who had been sent by his uncle on an embassy
to the King of Kajaaga, and was now returning
to his own country, was about to pay him a visit.
He came accordingly, and upon Park’s representing
to him his situation and distresses, kindly offered to
be his guide and protector as far as Kasson. With
him, therefore, our traveller now continued his route
to the banks of the Senegal, upon crossing which,
his royal guide, who, like other guides, required a
present for his services, informed him they were
in his uncle’s dominions, and in complete safety.</p>

<p>Safe or not safe, however, Park soon found that
the stranger and the traveller were nowhere beyond
the reach of extortion. Half of the little property
which had escaped the fangs of the Kajaaga people,
was here taken from him. He was then permitted
to depart. Among the honest negroes with whom
he had set out from Pisania, on the Gambia, there
was a blacksmith from the interior, who, having
amassed some little money upon the coast, was now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
returning to spend the remainder of his days in his
native land. Shortly after quitting Teesee, the last
place where our traveller had submitted to legal
robbery, he and his companions came within sight
of the blacksmith’s village. The news of his return
had, it seems, preceded him. His brother, accompanied
by a singing-man, came forth to welcome
the wanderer home, and brought along with him a
horse, that the blacksmith “might enter his native
town in a dignified manner.” Park and his companions
were desired to put a good charge of powder
into their guns. The singing-man led the way;
the two brothers followed; and the cavalcade was
quickly joined by a considerable number of the inhabitants,
who, by extravagant gestures and songs of
triumph, testified their joy at the return of their
townsman. “When we arrived at the blacksmith’s
place of residence, we dismounted, and fired our
muskets. The meeting between him and his relations
was very tender; for these rude children of
nature, freed from restraint, display their emotions
in the strongest and most expressive manner.&mdash;Amid
these transports, the blacksmith’s aged mother
was led forth, leaning upon a staff. Every one
made way for her; and she stretched out her hand
to bid her son welcome. Being totally blind, she
stroked his hands, and arms, and face with great
care, and seemed highly delighted that her latter
days were blessed by his return, and that her ears
once more heard the music of his voice. From this
interview, I was convinced, that whatever difference
there is between the Negro and European in the
conformation of the nose, and the colour of their
skin, there is none in the genuine sympathies and
characteristic feelings of our common nature.</p>

<p>“During the tumult of these congratulations, I had
seated myself apart, by the side of one of the huts,
being unwilling to interrupt the flow of filial and
parental tenderness; and the attention of the company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
was so entirely taken up with the blacksmith,
that I believe none of his friends had observed me.
When all the people present had seated themselves,
the blacksmith was desired by his father to give
some account of his adventures; and silence being
commanded he began; and after repeatedly thanking
God for the success that had attended him, related
every material occurrence that had happened to him
from his leaving Kasson to his arrival at the Gambia;
his employment and success in those parts; and the
dangers he had escaped in returning to his native
country. In the latter part of his narration, he had
frequent occasion to mention me; and after many
strong expressions concerning my kindness to him,
he pointed to the place where I sat, and exclaimed,
<i>Affille ibi siring</i> (see him sitting there). In a moment
all eyes were turned upon me. I appeared
like a being dropped from the clouds, every one
was surprised that they had not observed me before;
and a few women and children expressed great uneasiness
at being so near a man of such an uncommon
appearance. By degrees, however, their apprehensions
subsided, and when the blacksmith
assured them I was perfectly inoffensive, some of
them ventured so far as to examine the texture of my
clothes; but many of them were still very suspicious,
and when by accident I happened to move myself,
or look at the young children, their mothers would
scamper off with them with the greatest precipitation.
In a few hours, however, they all became reconciled
to me.”</p>

<p>With these honest people Park remained during
the whole of that day and the next, and then, accompanied
by the worthy blacksmith, who declared
he would not quit him during his stay in that part
of the country, set forward towards Kooniakary.
On his arrival at this city he obtained an audience
of the king, a fine old man, who, for his conduct
both in peace and war, was greatly beloved by his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
subjects. His behaviour towards the stranger was
not inconsistent with this character. He informed
him with apparent regret, that the direct route to
Bambarra was about to be closed by war, but, after
vainly advising his guest to retrace his footsteps,
added, that there yet remained some hopes of peace,
respecting the validity of which he should be able to
pronounce an opinion in the course of four or five
days. In the mean while he invited Park to remain
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On the 1st of February, 1796, the king’s messenger
returned from the contiguous kingdom of Kaarta,
bringing intelligence that the Bambarra army had
not yet entered the country, and that it was possible
the traveller might be enabled to traverse it before
the invasion should take place. Accordingly, being
provided with two guides by the king, Park took
leave of his friend the blacksmith, and set forward
on his dangerous journey. The country, at all times
thickly peopled, now swarmed with fugitives, whom
the fear of the Bambarrans had terrified from their
homes. The scenery in many places was romantically
wild. “On coming within sight of the mountains
of Foolado, we travelled,” says Park, “with
great difficulty down a stony and abrupt precipice,
and continued our way in the bed of a dried river-course,
where the trees meeting over our heads,
made the place dark and cool. In a little time we
reached the bottom of this romantic glen; and about
ten o’clock emerged from between two rocky hills,
and found ourselves on the level and sandy plains
of Kaarta. At noon we arrived at a korree, or
watering-place, where, for a few strings of beads, I
purchased as much milk and corn-meal as we could
eat; and indeed provisions are here so cheap, and
the shepherds live in such affluence, that they seldom
ask any return for what refreshment a traveller receives
from them.”</p>

<p>From this place, having prevailed upon his landlord,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
a Mohammedan negro, to accompany him as a
guide to Kemmoo, our traveller set forward on the
11th of February. He observes, “We had no sooner
got into a dark and lonely part of the first wood,
than he made a sign for us to stop; and taking hold
of a hollow piece of bamboo that hung as an amulet
round his neck, whistled very loud three times. I
confess I was somewhat startled, thinking it was a
signal for some of his companions to come and
attack us; but he assured me it was done merely
with a view to ascertain what success we were
likely to meet with on our present journey. He
then dismounted, laid his spear across the road, and
having said a number of short prayers, concluded with
three loud whistles; after which he listened for some
time, as if in expectation of an answer, and receiving
none, told us we might proceed without fear, for
there was no danger.”</p>

<p>Adventures now appeared to crowd upon our traveller.
The country through which their road lay
being thickly sprinkled with wild fruit-trees, they
amused themselves as they rode slowly along with
picking and eating the fruit. “In this pursuit,”
says Park, “I had wandered a little from my people,
and being uncertain whether they were before or
behind me, I hastened to a rising ground to look about
me. As I was proceeding towards this eminence,
two negro horsemen, armed with muskets, came
galloping from among the bushes. On seeing them
I made a full stop; the horsemen did the same; and
all three of us seemed equally surprised and confounded
at this interview. As I approached them
their fears increased, and one of them, after casting on
me a look of horror, rode off at full speed; the other,
in a panic of fear, put his hand over his eyes, and continued
muttering prayers until his horse, seemingly
without his rider’s knowledge, conveyed him slowly
after his companion. About a mile to the westward
they fell in with my attendants, to whom they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
related a frightful story; it seems their fears had
dressed me in the flowing robes of a tremendous
spirit; and one of them affirmed, that when I made
my appearance, a cold blast of wind came pouring
down upon him from the sky, like so much cold
water.”</p>

<p>Shortly after this they arrived at the capital of
Kaarta, where he was an object of such extraordinary
curiosity to the populace, the majority of whom
had never before seen a white man, that they burst
forcibly into his hut, crowd after crowd. Those
who had beheld the monster giving way to those
who had not, until, as he observes, the hut was filled
and emptied thirteen different times. Here he found
that the war with Bambarra had actually commenced;
that all communication between the countries had
consequently ceased; and that, if it was his determination
to persevere, it would be necessary to take
a circuitous route through the Moorish kingdom of
Ludamar. The people of Kaarta were Mohammedans;
but there is a variety in church discipline
even among these inflexible fanatics; for, instead
of the fine sonorous voice of the muezzin, by which
the faithful are elsewhere summoned to their devotions,
the hour of prayer was here announced by
the beating of drums, and blowing through large
elephant’s teeth, hollowed out in such a manner as
to resemble buglehorns. The sound of these horns
our traveller thought melodious, and approaching
nearer to the human voice than any other artificial
sound. Being very desirous to depart from the seat
of war, Park presented his horse-pistols and holsters
to the king; and on pressing to be dismissed, received
in return an escort of eight horsemen to conduct
him to Jarra. Three of the king’s sons, with
two hundred horsemen, kindly undertook to accompany
him a little way on his journey.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Jarra, in the kingdom of Ludamar,
he despatched a messenger to Ali, who was then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
encamped near Benowm, soliciting permission to
pass unmolested through his territories; and having
waited fourteen days for his reply, a slave at length
arrived from the chief, affirming that he had been
instructed to conduct the traveller in safety as far
as Goomba. His negro, Johnson, here refused to
follow him any further, and signified his intention
of pushing back without delay to Gambia; upon
which Park, fearful of the success of his enterprise,
intrusted him with a copy of his journal, reserving
another for himself, directing him to deliver the
papers to the English on the coast. A portion of
his baggage and apparel he committed to the care
of a slave-merchant at Jarra, who was known to
Dr. Laidley. He then departed with his slave-boy,
accompanied by the chief’s messenger. On the road
our traveller was robbed once more by the Moors,
who added insult to violence; and when he was
nearly perishing for thirst, beat away his faithful
slave from the wells, without permitting him to draw
water.</p>

<p>However, after much fatigue and extraordinary
privations, they arrived in Ali’s camp at Benowm,
where Park was immediately surrounded by crowds
of fanatical Moors, attracted partly by curiosity,
partly from a desire to vent their fierce zeal against
a Christian. “My arrival,” says he, “was no sooner
observed than the people, who drew water at the wells,
threw down their buckets; those in the tents mounted
their horses, and men, women, and children came
running or galloping towards me. I soon found myself
surrounded by such a crowd, that I could scarcely
move; one pulled my clothes, another took off my
hat; a third stopped me to examine my waistcoat
buttons, and a fourth called out ‘La illah el allah
Mahamet rasowl allahi,’ and signified, in a threatening
manner, that I must repeat those words. We
reached at length the king’s tent, where we found a
great number of people, men, women, and children,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
assembled. Ali was sitting on a black leathern
cushion, clipping a few hairs from his upper lip&mdash;a
female attendant holding up a looking-glass before
him. He appeared to be an old man of the Arab
cast, with a long white beard, and he had a sullen
and indignant aspect. He surveyed me with attention,
and inquired of the Moors if I could speak
Arabic; being answered in the negative, he appeared
much surprised, and continued silent. The surrounding
attendants, and particularly the ladies,
were abundantly more inquisitive; they asked a
thousand questions, inspected every part of my
apparel, searched my pockets, and obliged me to
unbutton my waistcoat and display the whiteness
of my skin; they even counted my toes and fingers,
as if they doubted whether I was in truth a human
being.”</p>

<p>Ali now, with the base idea of insulting an unprotected
stranger, ordered a wild boar to be brought
in, which he signified his desire that Park should
kill and eat. This, well knowing their religious
prejudices, he of course refused to do; upon which
the boys who led in the boar were commanded to
let it loose upon him, the Moors supposing that there
exists an inveterate feud between pigs and Christians,
and that it would immediately run upon and
gore him. The boar, however, was more magnanimous.
Scorning to attack a defenceless foreigner,
he no sooner found himself at liberty than, brandishing
his tusks at the natives, he rushed at them indiscriminately,
and then, to complete the consternation,
took shelter under the very couch upon which
the tyrant was sitting. This bold proceeding of the
unclean beast dissolved the assembly, and the traveller
was led away to the tent of a slave, in front
of which, not being permitted to enter, he received
a little food. Here he likewise passed the night
lying upon the sand, surrounded by the curious multitude.
Next day, a hut, constructed with corn-stalks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
was given him; but the abovementioned boar,
which had been recaptured, was tied to a stake in
the corner of it, as his fittest companion.</p>

<p>By degrees, however, the Moors began to conceive
that the Christian might in one way or another be
rendered useful, but could think of no better employment
for him than that of a barber. In this
capacity he made his first attempt, in the royal presence,
on the head of the young prince of Ludamar.
This dignified office he had no great desire to monopolize,
and his unskilfulness in performing the operation,
for he almost at the outset made an incision in the
young prince’s head, quickly reduced him once more
to the rank of a common mortal. Ali seemed by
no means desirous, however, of dispensing altogether
with his services, wishing perhaps to preserve him
from the same motives which induce us to preserve
a wild beast; and therefore, to render his escape
the more impracticable, took possession of the whole
of his baggage, including his gold, amber, watch,
and one of his pocket compasses; the other he
had fortunately buried in the sand composing the
floor of his hut. The gold and amber were highly
gratifying to Moorish avarice, but the pocket compass
soon became an object of superstitious curiosity.
“Ali was very desirous to be informed, why
that small piece of iron, the needle, always pointed
to the Great Desert, and I found myself somewhat
puzzled to answer the question. To have pleaded
my ignorance, would have created a suspicion that I
wished to conceal the real truth from him; I therefore
told him that my mother resided far beyond
the sands of Sahara, and that while she was alive,
the piece of iron would always point that way, and
serve as a guide to conduct me to her; and that if
she was dead, it would point to her grave. Ali
now looked at the compass with redoubled amazement;
turned it round and round repeatedly, but observing
that it always pointed the same way, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
took it up with great caution, and returned it to me,
manifesting that he thought there was something of
magic in it, and that he was afraid of keeping so
dangerous an instrument in his possession.”</p>

<p>It now began to be debated between Ali and his
advisers what should be done with their prisoner.
Their decisions were very dissimilar. Some were of
opinion that he should be put to death; others that he
should merely lose his right hand; while a third party
thought that his eyes ought to be put out. Ali himself,
however, determined that matters should remain
as they were until his queen Fatima, then in the north,
had seen him. Meanwhile all these reports were
related to our traveller, and tended not a little to distress
and agitate his mind. His demand to be permitted
to depart was formally refused. The accumulated
horrors of his situation, united with the want of
food and sleep, at length brought on a fever, by which
his life was endangered. But his persecution from
the Moors did not therefore cease. They plucked
his cloak from him; they overwhelmed him with
insults; they tortured him like some ferocious
animal, for their amusement; and when, to escape
from this detestable thraldom, he crawled away to a
short distance from the camp, he was forced back by
menaces and violence.</p>

<p>At length, after more than a month’s detention at
Benowm, he was commanded to follow Ali to the
northern encampment of Bubaker, on the skirts of
the Great Desert, and on the way endured the extremity
of hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Upon arriving
at Bubaker, he was shown as a strange animal
to Fatima; who, though far from being exempt from
the Moorish prejudices against a Christian, or in any
remarkable degree disposed to humanity, still treated
him with somewhat greater lenity than the rest of
the Moors; and, upon the departure of her husband
for Jarra, not only obtained him permission to join
the party, but prevailed upon the tyrant to restore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
him his horse, saddle, and bridle, together with a
part of his apparel. His faithful black boy Demba,
however, was taken from him, notwithstanding his
animated remonstrances to Ali, who, upon his
pressing the point rather warmly, only replied, that
if he did not instantly mount his horse and depart,
he should share the fate of his slave. “There is
something in the frown of a tyrant,” says Park,
“which rouses the most secret emotions of the
heart; I could not suppress my feelings; and for
once entertained an indignant wish to rid the world
of such a monster. Poor Demba was not less
affected than myself; he had formed a strong attachment
towards me, and had a cheerfulness of disposition
which often beguiled the tedious hours of captivity;
he was likewise a proficient in the Bambarra
tongue, and promised, on that account, to be of
great use to me in future. But it was in vain to
expect any thing favourable to humanity from a
people who are strangers to its dictates. So having
shaken hands with this unfortunate boy, and blended
my tears with his, assuring him, however, I would
do the best to redeem him, I saw him led off by
three of Ali’s slaves towards the camp at Bubaker.”</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at Jarra, where he was shortly
afterward transferred by Ali to tyrants of a lower
grade, his condition, far from being improved, was
only rendered the more intolerable. The city itself,
moreover, was in a state of the utmost confusion.
Malcontents from Kaarta having taken refuge here,
had recently made an incursion into their native
country, carried off a large quantity of plunder, and
thus drawn the vengeance of their king against the
city. All those who had reason to dread his resentment
were now, therefore, preparing to fly into Bambarra;
and Park, whose route lay in the same direction,
became exceedingly desirous of effecting his
escape from the Moors, that he might seize upon
this fortunate occasion of fulfilling the object of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
mission. “Their departure,” says he, speaking of
the black fugitives, “was very affecting: the women
and children crying, the men sullen and dejected, and
all of them looking back with regret on their native
town; and on the wells and rocks beyond which
their ambition had never tempted them to stray, and
where they had laid all their plans of future happiness;
all of which they were now forced to abandon,
and to seek shelter among strangers.”</p>

<p>Hoping to escape in this confused throng, he
mounted his horse; and taking a bag of corn before
him, rode slowly off along with the townspeople.
On their arrival at Queira, a village at no great distance
from the city, Park began to flatter himself
that he had really eluded the vigilance of his persecutors;
but before the agreeable idea had got a firm
footing in his mind, he saw Ali’s chief slave, accompanied
by four Moors, arrive, and take up their
lodgings with the dooty. Johnson, our traveller’s
interpreter, suspecting the design of this visit, sent
two boys to overhear their conversation, by which
means he learned that it was their intention to carry
Park back to Bubaker. Upon this he at once came
to the desperate resolution to effect his deliverance
that very night from his pursuers, or to perish in
the attempt. Johnson, who applauded this determination,
but wanted the courage to imitate it, was
nevertheless exceedingly well disposed to aid in
effecting his master’s escape. He therefore undertook
to keep watch upon the movements of the
enemy, while Park was preparing for flight. About
midnight he got all his apparel in readiness, which
consisted of two shirts, two pair of trousers, two
pocket-handkerchiefs, an upper and under waistcoat,
a hat, a pair of half-boots, and a cloak. Besides
these things he had not in his possession a single
bead, or any other article, with which to purchase
food for himself, or provender for his horse:&mdash;“About
daybreak, Johnson, who had been listening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
to the Moors all night, came,” says he, “and whispered
to me that they were all asleep. The awful
crisis was now arrived when I was again either to
taste the blessings of freedom, or languish out my
days in captivity. A cold sweat moistened my forehead
as I thought of the dreadful alternative, and
reflected that one way or the other, my fate must be
decided in the course of the ensuing day. But to
deliberate was to lose the only chance of escaping.
So taking up my bundle, I stepped gently over the
negroes who were sleeping in the open air; and,
having mounted my horse, I bade Johnson farewell,
desiring him to take particular care of the papers I
had intrusted him with, and inform my friends in
Gambia that he had left me in good health on my
way to Bambarra. I proceeded with great caution,
surveying each bush, and frequently listening and
looking behind me for the Moorish horsemen, until
I was about a mile from the town, when I was surprised
to find myself in the neighbourhood of a
korree, belonging to the Moors. The shepherds followed
me for about a mile, hooting and throwing
stones after me; and when I was out of their reach,
and had begun to indulge the pleasing hope of escaping,
I was again greatly alarmed to hear somebody
halloo behind me; and looking back I saw three
Moors on horseback, coming after me at full speed,
whooping and brandishing their double-barrel guns:
I knew it was in vain to think of escaping, and therefore
turned back and met them; when two of them
caught hold of my bridle, one on each side, and the
third, presenting his musket, told me I must go back
to Ali.”</p>

<p>It soon appeared, however, that these gentlemen
were merely private robbers, who were fearful that
their master had not sufficiently pillaged the stranger;
for, after examining his bundle, and plundering him
of his cloak, they bade him begone, and follow them
no further. Too happy to be rid of the villains at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
any rate, he immediately struck into the woods, and
continued his journey. His joy at thus escaping
from the Moors was quickly damped by the consideration
that he must very soon be in want of both
food and water, neither of which could he procure
without approaching villages or wells, where he
would almost inevitably encounter his old enemies.
He therefore pushed on with all the vigour of which
he was possessed, in the hope of reaching some
town or village of the kingdom of Bambarra. But
he already began to experience the tortures of thirst.
His mouth was parched and inflamed; a sudden
dimness, accompanied by symptoms of fainting,
would frequently come over his eyes; and as his
horse also was exceedingly fatigued, he began to apprehend
that he should perish of thirst. Some
shrubs, the leaves of which he chewed to relieve the
burning pain in his mouth and throat, were all found
to be bitter and of no service. “A little before
sunset, having reached the top of a gentle rising,”
says Park, “I climbed a high tree, from the topmost
branches of which I cast a melancholy look over the
barren wilderness, but without discovering the most
distant trace of a human dwelling. The same
dismal uniformity of shrubs and sand everywhere
presented itself, and the horizon was level and uninterrupted
as that of the sea.</p>

<p>“Descending from the tree, I found my horse devouring
the stubble and brushwood with great
avidity; and as I was now too faint to attempt
walking, and my horse too much fatigued to carry
me, I thought it but an act of humanity, and perhaps
the last I should ever have it in my power to perform,
to take off his bridle and let him shift for himself;
in doing which, I was affected with sickness and
giddiness; and, falling upon the sand, felt as if the
hour of death was fast approaching. Here then
(thought I), after a short but ineffectual struggle,
terminate all my hopes of being useful in my day
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and generation&mdash;here must the short span of my life
come to an end. I cast, as I believed, a last look on
the surrounding scene, and while I reflected on the
awful change that was about to take place, this
world and its enjoyments seemed to vanish from my
recollection. Nature, however, at length resumed
its functions; and on recovering my senses I found
myself stretched upon the sand, with the bridle still
in my hand, and the sun just sinking behind the trees.
I now summoned all my resolution, and determined
to make another effort to prolong my existence:
and, as the evening was somewhat cool, I resolved to
travel as far as my limbs would carry me, in hopes
of reaching (my only resource) a watering-place.
With this view I put the bridle upon my horse, and
driving him before me, went slowly along for about
an hour, when I perceived some lightning from the
north-east&mdash;a most delightful sight, for it promised
rain. The darkness and lightning increased very
rapidly; and in less than an hour I heard the wind
roaring behind the bushes. I had already opened
my mouth to receive the refreshing drops which I
expected: but I was instantly covered with a cloud
of sand, driven with such force by the wind as to
give a very disagreeable sensation to my face and
arms; and I was obliged to mount my horse and
stop under a bush to prevent being suffocated. The
sand continued to fly for near an hour in amazing
quantities, after which I again set forward, and travelled
with difficulty until ten o’clock. About this
time I was agreeably surprised by some very vivid
flashes of lightning, followed by a few heavy drops
of rain. In a little time the sand ceased to fly, and
I alighted and spread out all my clean clothes to
collect the rain, which at length I saw would certainly
fall. For more than an hour it rained plentifully,
and I quenched my thirst by wringing and
sucking my clothes.</p>

<p>“There being no moon, it was remarkably dark; so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
that I was obliged to lead my horse, and direct my
way by the compass, which the lightning enabled me
to observe. In this manner I travelled with tolerable
expedition until past midnight; when the lightning
became more distant, and I was under the necessity
of groping along, to the no small danger of my
hands and eyes. About two o’clock my horse started
at something; and, looking round, I was not a little
surprised to see a light at a short distance among the
trees, and supposing it to be a town, I groped along
the sand in hopes of finding corn-stalks, cotton, or
other appearances of cultivation, but found none.
As I approached, I perceived a number of other
lights in different places, and began to suspect that I
had fallen upon a party of Moors. However, in my
present situation, I was resolved to see who they
were, if I could do it with safety. I accordingly led
my horse cautiously towards the light, and heard by
the lowing of the cattle, and the clamorous tongues
of the herdsmen, that it was a watering-place, and
most likely belonged to the Moors. Delightful as
the sound of the human voice was to me, I resolved
once more to strike into the woods, and rather run
the risk of perishing with hunger, than trust myself
again in their hands; but being still thirsty, and
dreading the approach of the burning day, I thought
it prudent to search for the wells, which I expected
to find at no great distance. In this pursuit I inadvertently
approached so near one of the tents as to
to be perceived by a woman, who immediately
screamed out. The people came running to her
assistance from some of the neighbouring tents, and
passed so very near me that I thought I was discovered,
and hastened again into the woods.</p>

<p>“About a mile from this place I heard a loud and
confused noise, somewhere to the right of my
course, and in a short time was happy to find it was
the croaking of frogs, which was heavenly music to
my ears. I followed the sound, and at daybreak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
arrived at some shallow muddy pools, so full of
frogs that it was difficult to discern the water. The
noise they made frightened my horse, and I was
obliged to keep them quiet by beating the water with
a branch until he had drunk. Having here quenched
my thirst, I ascended a tree, and the morning being
clear, I soon perceived the smoke of the watering-place
which I had passed in the night, and observed
another pillar of smoke, east-southeast, distant 12
or 14 miles.”</p>

<p>Towards this column of smoke, which, as he was
informed, arose from a Foulah village, he now
directed his course; but on arriving at the place,
was inhospitably driven from every door, except that
of an old woman, who kindly received him into her
dwelling, and furnished him with food for himself
and with provender for his horse. Even here, however,
the influence of Ali pursued him like his evil
genius. The people who had collected round him
while he was eating, began, as he clearly discovered
from their expressions, to form the design of carrying
him back once more to Benowm or Bubaker.
He therefore hastened his departure, and having
wandered among the woods all day, passed the night
under a tree. In this way he continued his journey,
sometimes meeting with hospitality, but more frequently
avoiding the dwellings of man, and subsisting
upon the wild produce of the woods, and the
water of a few pools, to which the croaking of the
frogs directed him.</p>

<p>At length he entered the kingdom of Bambarra,
where he found the people more hospitable in proportion
as they were more opulent than their neighbours.
Cultivation was here carried on in a spirited
manner and on an extensive scale, and “hunger,”
as the natives expressed it, “was never known.”
The country itself was beautiful, intersected on all
sides by rivulets, which, after a rain-storm, were
swelled into rapid streams. Park’s horse was now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
so attenuated by fatigue that it appeared like a mere
skeleton, which the traveller, fearing to mount,
drove before him, as if to scare away the crows.
The Bambarrans, whose hospitable disposition was
accompanied by but little delicacy, were infinitely
amused at this droll spectacle. Taking him for a
Moor, they supposed from his appearance that he
must be one of those religious mendicants who, having
performed the pilgrimage to the holy cities,
thenceforward consider themselves fully entitled to
subsist upon the labours of their industrious coreligionists.
“‘He has been at Mecca,’ said one;
‘you may see that by his clothes.’ Another asked
if my horse was sick; a third wished to purchase
it, &amp;c. So that I believe the very slaves were
ashamed to be seen in my company.”</p>

<p>However, in spite of all this laughter and ridicule,
he proceeded on his way, and at length had the satisfaction
to be informed that on the morrow he should
see the Niger, denominated <i>Joliba</i>, or the “Great
Water,” by the natives. Next morning, the 21st of
July, after passing through several large villages, he
saw the smoke ascend over Sego, the capital of Bambarra,
and felt elate with joy at the thought of drawing
near so important an object of his mission. “As
we approached the town,” says Park, “I was fortunate
enough to overtake the fugitive Kaartans, to
whose kindness I had been so much indebted in my
journey through Bambarra. They readily agreed
to introduce me to the king, and we rode together
through some marshy ground, where, as I anxiously
looked around for the river, one of them called out
<i>Geo affilli</i> (see the water); and, looking forward, I
saw with infinite pleasure the great object of my
mission,&mdash;the long sought for, majestic Niger, glittering
to the morning sun, as broad as the Thames
at Westminster, and flowing slowly <i>to the eastward</i>.
I hastened to the brink, and, having drunk of the
water, lifted up my fervent thanks in prayer to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Great Ruler of all things for having thus far crowned
my endeavours with success.”</p>

<p>Sego, the capital of Bambarra, consisted of four
distinct towns, two on the northern, and two on the
southern bank of the Niger. The king at this period
resided on the southern bank, while Park had arrived
on the opposite side. The communication
between the different quarters of the city was kept
up by means of large canoes, which were constantly
passing and repassing; notwithstanding which, so
great was the pressure of passengers, that Park was
compelled to wait upwards of two hours before he
could obtain even a chance of being ferried over.
Meanwhile, the prospect before him was novel and
striking in the highest degree. “The view of this
extensive city,” he observes, “the numerous canoes
on the river, the crowded population, and the cultivated
state of the surrounding country formed altogether
a prospect of civilization and magnificence
which I little expected to find in the bosom of Africa.”</p>

<p>While he was thus waiting for a passage, the news
was conveyed to Mansong that a white man was on
the banks of the river coming to see him. The king,
who seems to have been alarmed at this intelligence,
immediately despatched a messenger, who was directed
to inform the stranger that he would not be
admitted into the royal presence until the purport
of his mission were made known; and that, in the
mean while, he was prohibited from passing the
river. He was likewise told that the king desired
him to seek lodgings in one of the villages in the
vicinity of the capital. As there was no alternative,
he at once set out for the village, where, to his great
mortification, he found that no person would admit
him into his house. “I was regarded with astonishment
and fear,” he observes, “and was obliged to
sit all day without victuals in the shade of a tree;
and the night threatened to be very uncomfortable,
for the wind rose, and there was great appearance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of a heavy rain; and the wild beasts were so very
numerous in the neighbourhood, that I should have
been under the necessity of climbing up a tree, and
resting among the branches. About sunset, however,
as I was preparing to pass the night in this
manner, and had turned my horse loose that he might
graze at liberty, a woman returning from the labours
of the field stopped to observe me, and, perceiving
that I was weary and dejected, inquired into my
situation, which I briefly explained to her; whereupon,
with looks of great compassion, she took up
my saddle and bridle, and told me to follow her.
Having conducted me into her hut, she lighted up a
lamp, spread a mat upon the floor, and told me I might
remain there for the night. Finding that I was very
hungry, she said she would procure me something
to eat; she accordingly went out, and returned in a
short time with a very fine fish, which, having
caused to be half-broiled upon some embers, she
gave me for supper. The rites of hospitality being
thus performed towards a stranger in distress, my
worthy benefactress, pointing to the mat, and telling
me I might sleep there without apprehension, called
to the female part of her family, who had stood gazing
on me all the while in fixed astonishment, to resume
their task of spinning cotton, in which they
continued to employ themselves great part of the
night. They lightened their labour by songs, one
of which was composed extempore, for I was myself
the subject of it; it was sung by one of the young
women, the rest joining in a sort of chorus. The
air was sweet and plaintive, and the words literally
translated were these:&mdash;‘The winds roared, and the
rains fell; the poor white man, faint and weary,
came and sat under our tree; he has no mother to
bring him milk, no wife to grind his corn.’ Chorus:&mdash;‘Let
us pity the white man, no mother has he,’
&amp;c. Trifling as this recital may appear to the
reader, to a person in my situation the circumstance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
was affecting in the highest degree. I was oppressed
by such unexpected kindness that sleep fled my
eyes. In the morning I presented my compassionate
landlady with two of the four brass buttons which
remained on my waistcoat, the only recompense I
could make her.”</p>

<p>Although Mansong refused to admit our traveller
into his presence, and seemed at first to neglect him,
it soon appeared that this conduct did not arise from
any churlish or inhospitable feelings; for while he
persisted in his refusal to see him, and signified his
pleasure that he should forthwith depart from the
city, he sent him a present of five thousand cowries
and a guide to Sansanding. Park immediately
obeyed the royal command, and learned from the
conversation of his guide on the way, that the king’s
motives for thus dismissing him without an audience
were at once prudent and liberal, since he feared
that by the least show of favour he should excite the
jealousy and envy of the Moorish inhabitants, from
whose inveterate malice he might be unable to protect
him.</p>

<p>With this guide he proceeded to Sansanding, where
he was hospitably received by the dooty, and would,
as the king’s stranger, have enjoyed much quiet and
consideration, had he not had the misfortune to meet
with some of his old enemies the Moors, who insisted
on conducting him to the mosque, and converting
him into a Mohammedan at once. However,
the dooty, by exerting his authority, freed him from
these fanatics, and ordered a sheep to be killed, and
part of it dressed for his supper. “About midnight,
when the Moors had left me,” says Park, “he paid
me a visit, and with much earnestness desired me
to write him a saphie. ‘If a Moor’s saphie is good,’
said this hospitable old man, ‘a white man’s must
needs be better.’ I readily furnished him with one
possessed of all the virtues I could concentrate, for
it contained the Lord’s Prayer. The pen with which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
it was written was made of a reed, a little charcoal
and gum-water made very tolerable ink, and a thin
board answered the purpose of paper.”</p>

<p>From Sansanding he departed early in the morning,
before the Moors were stirring. The road now
lay through the woods, and the guide, who understood
the dangers of the way, moved forward with
the greatest circumspection, frequently stopping and
looking under the bushes. Upon observing this,
Park inquired the reason, and was told that lions
were very plentiful in that part of the country, and
very often attacked travellers in the woods. While
they were conversing on this subject Park discovered
a camelopard at a little distance, the fore-legs
of which, from a hasty glance, appeared much longer
than the hinder. “Shortly after this,” says he, “as
we were crossing a large open plain where there
were a few scattered bushes, my guide, who was a
little way before me, wheeled his horse round in a
moment, calling out something in the Foulah language
which I did not understand. I inquired in
Mandingo what he meant. ‘<i>Wara billi billi</i>’ (a very
large lion)! said he, and made signs for me to ride
away. But my horse was too much fatigued; so
we rode slowly past the bush from which the animal
had given us the alarm. Not seeing any thing myself,
however, I thought my guide had been mistaken,
when the Foulah suddenly put his hand to his mouth,
exclaiming, ‘<i>Soubah an alluhi</i>’ (God preserve us)!
and to my great surprise I then perceived a large
red lion at a short distance from the bush, with his
head couched between his fore-paws. I expected
he would instantly spring upon me, and instinctively
pulled my feet from my stirrups to throw myself on
the ground, that my horse might become the victim
rather than myself. But it is probable the lion was
not hungry; for he quietly suffered us to pass, though
we were fairly within his reach.”</p>

<p>About sunset they arrived at Moodiboo, “a delightful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
village on the banks of the Niger, commanding
a view of the river for many miles, both to the
east and west. The small green islands, the peaceful
retreat of some industrious Foulahs, whose cattle
were here secure from the attacks of wild beasts,
and the majestic breadth of the river, which is here
much larger than at Sego, render the situation one
of the most enchanting in the world.” Park was
now so worn out with fatigue and suffering, that his
landlord, fearing he might die in his house, hurried
him away, though he was scarcely able to walk, and
his horse still less able to carry him. In fact, they
had not proceeded far before the poor beast fell
down, and could no more be made to rise; so that,
taking off his saddle and bridle, our traveller with
extreme reluctance abandoned him to his fate, and
began to toil along on foot after his guide. In this
way they reached Kea, a small fishing-village on the
Niger, where Park embarked in a fisherman’s canoe
which was going down the stream, while the guide
returned to Sego.</p>

<p>In this canoe our traveller reached Moorzan,
whence he was conveyed across the river to Silla, a
large town on the opposite shore. It was with great
difficulty that he here obtained admission into the
strangers’ room of the dooty’s house, a damp, uncomfortable
place, where he had a severe paroxysm
of fever during the night. Here his resolution and
energy, of which no traveller ever possessed a larger
share, began at length to fail. No hope of success
remained. He therefore, with extreme sorrow and
anguish of mind, determined on returning whence he
had come; but let me lay before the reader his own
simple and manly account of the matter, which cannot
fail to impress even the most insensible with
veneration for a degree of courage and intrepidity
amounting to heroism. “Worn down by sickness,
exhausted by hunger and fatigue, half-naked, and
without any article of value by which I might procure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
provisions, clothes, or lodging, I began,” says
Park, “to reflect seriously on my situation. I was
now convinced by painful experience that the obstacles
to my further progress were insurmountable.
The tropical rains had already set in with all their
violence; the rice-grounds and swamps were already
overflowed; and in a few days more travelling of
every kind except by water would be completely obstructed.
The cowries which remained of the King
of Bambarra’s present were not sufficient to hire a
canoe for any great distance; and I had but little
hopes of subsisting by charity in a country where
the Moors have such influence. But, above all, I
perceived I was advancing more and more within the
power of those merciless fanatics; and from my reception
both at Sego and Sansanding, I was apprehensive
that, in attempting to reach even Jeuné (unless
under the protection of some man of consequence
among them, which I had no means of obtaining), I
should sacrifice my life to no purpose; for my discoveries
would perish with me. The prospect either
way was gloomy. In returning to the Gambia, a
journey on foot of many hundred miles presented
itself to my contemplation, through regions and
countries unknown. Nevertheless, this seemed to
be the only alternative; for I saw inevitable destruction
in attempting to proceed to the eastward. With
this conviction on my mind, I hope my readers will
acknowledge I did right in going no farther. I had
made every exertion to execute my mission in its
fullest extent which prudence could justify. Had
there been the most distant prospect of a successful
termination, neither the unavoidable hardships of
the journey nor the dangers of a second captivity
should have forced me to desist. This, however,
necessity compelled me to do.”</p>

<p>When he had come to this resolution, he thought
it incumbent upon him before he left Silla to collect
whatever information might be within his reach respecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the further course of the Niger, and the
situation and extent of the various kingdoms in its
vicinity. Subsequent travellers have solved the
problem, the honour of explaining which was denied
to Park. We now know that this great river, after
having flowed to a considerable distance eastward
of Timbuctoo, makes a bend or elbow like the Burrampooter,
and, after pursuing a south-westerly
course, falls into the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of
Benin.</p>

<p>On the 30th of July our traveller commenced his
return westward, by the same route through which
he had reached Silla. In a few days he recovered
his horse, which had in some measure regained its
strength, though it was still too weak to be ridden.
The rainy season having now set in, the whole of
the plain country was quickly inundated; so that
our traveller was often in danger of losing his way
while traversing savannahs many miles in extent,
knee-deep in water. In several places he waded
breast-deep across the swamps. The huts of the
villages in which he passed the night, being undermined
or softened by the rain, often fell in; and the
noise of their fall sometimes kept him awake, expecting
that his own might be the next. His situation
was now even worse than during his progress
eastward. A report had been widely circulated that
he was a spy, in consequence of which he was in
some places civilly refused admittance into the
towns, in others repulsed from the gates with violence;
so that he now appeared inevitably doomed
to perish of hunger. However, when the fatal hour
seemed at hand, some charitable being always appeared
with a poor but seasonable supply, such, perhaps,
as a little raw corn, which prolonged his life,
and supplied him with strength to achieve his memorable
journey. “On the evening of the 15th of August
I arrived,” says Park, “at a small village called
Song, the surly inhabitants of which would not receive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
me, nor so much as permit me to enter the
gate; but as lions were very numerous in this neighbourhood,
and I had frequently in the course of the
day seen the impression of their feet upon the road,
I resolved to stay in the vicinity of the village.
Having collected some grass for my horse, I accordingly
laid down under a tree by the gate. About
ten o’clock I heard the hollow roar of a lion at no
great distance, and attempted to open the gate; but
the people from within told me that no person must
attempt to enter the gate without the dooty’s permission.
I begged them to inform the dooty that a
lion was approaching the village, and I hoped he
would allow me to come within the gate. I waited
for an answer to this message with great anxiety;
for the lion kept prowling round the village, and
once advanced so very near me that I heard him
rustling among the grass, and climbed the tree for
safety. About midnight the dooty with some of his
people opened the gate, and desired me to come in.
They were convinced, they said, I was not a Moor;
for no Moor ever waited any time at the gate of a
village without cursing the inhabitants.”</p>

<p>The history of this journey now becomes nothing
more than a repetition of similar sufferings. Hunger,
fatigue, and depression of spirits attack the traveller
by turns. Nothing, however, subdues his courage.
Obstacle after obstacle yields to his persevering intrepidity,
and he pushes forward with invincible
ardour towards the coast. In one place, at the request
of a native who had grown opulent by industrious
application to commerce, he wrote charms for
a good supper; and, finding the contrivance productive,
continued the practice next day for small presents
of various kinds. On other occasions, where
superstition did not come to his aid, humanity interposed,
and snatched him from starvation. At Bammakoo
he was hospitably treated, even by a Moor,
who, having travelled to Rio Grande, had conversed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
with Christians, and conceived a favourable idea of
their character. The rains had now increased the
Niger to a vast size, and rendered impassable almost
every road; but, as our traveller’s finances had long
been exhausted, he found himself compelled to proceed,
the charity of the natives not extending so far
as to the maintaining of a stranger for several
months. The ordinary roads being obstructed by
the rains, the only practicable route, wild, dreary,
and desolate, lay over steril rocky mountains, over
which, it was feared, a horse could not pass.</p>

<p>Finding that a singing-man was about to proceed
by this road to Sibidooloo, Park placed himself under
his guidance, and quitted Bammakoo. He had not
proceeded far, however, before his companion, finding
that he had taken the wrong path, escaped among
the rocks, and left him to find his way how he might.
He soon arrived at a village, where he was entertained
with hospitality, and where he passed the
night. Next day, as he was quietly pursuing his
course, a troop of peasants presented themselves,
whom he at first took for elephant-hunters, but who
very shortly proved themselves to be banditti. Pretending
to arrest him in the name of the King of the
Foulahs, they commanded him to follow them, until,
having reached a dark lonely part of a wood, one of
them exclaimed in the Mandingo language, “This
place will do!” and immediately snatched his hat
from his head. “Though I was by no means free
from apprehension,” says Park, “yet I was resolved
to show as few signs of fear as possible; and therefore
told them, that unless my hat was returned to
me I should proceed no farther. But before I had
time to receive an answer another drew a knife, and,
seizing upon a metal button which remained upon
my waistcoat, cut it off, and put it into his pocket.
Their intentions were now obvious; and I thought
that the easier they were permitted to rob me of
every thing the less I had to fear. I therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
allowed them to search my pockets without resistance,
and examine every part of my apparel, which
they did with the most scrupulous exactness. But,
observing that I had one waistcoat under another,
they insisted that I should cast them both off; and
at last, to make sure work, stripped me quite naked.
Even my half-boots, though the sole of one of them
was tied on to my foot with a broken bridle-rein,
were minutely inspected. While they were examining
the plunder, I begged them with great earnestness
to return my pocket-compass; but when I
pointed it out to them, as it was lying on the ground,
one of the banditti, thinking I was about to take it
up, cocked his musket, and swore he would lay me
dead upon the spot if I presumed to put my hand
upon it. After this, some of them went away with
my horse, and the remainder stood considering
whether they should leave me quite naked, or allow
me something to shelter me from the sun. Humanity
at last prevailed; they returned me the worst of the
two shirts and a pair of trousers; and, as they went
away, one of them threw back my hat, in the crown
of which I kept my memorandums; and this was
probably the reason why they did not wish to
keep it.”</p>

<p>This was the most terrible misfortune that had
hitherto befallen him, and at first, his mind appeared
to sink under the united influence of grief and terror.
For a while he sat in sullen dejection, half-persuaded
that he had no alternative but to lie down and perish.
Presently, however, thoughts of religion, and a reliance
upon Providence, succeeding this extreme
dejection, his mind gradually regained its fervent
tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I was, indeed, a stranger,” he thought, “in a
strange land; yet I was still under the protecting
eye of that Providence, who has condescended to
call himself the stranger’s friend. At this moment,
painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
beauty of a small moss in fructification irresistibly
caught my eye. I mention this to show from what
trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive
consolation; for though the whole plant was
not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could
not contemplate the delicate conformation of its
roots, leaves, and capsula without admiration. Can
that Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and
brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the
world, a thing which appears of so small importance,
look with unconcern upon the situation and sufferings
of creatures formed after his own image?
Surely not! Reflections like these would not allow
me to despair; I started up, and, disregarding both
danger and fatigue, travelled forwards, assured that
relief was at hand; and I was not disappointed.”</p>

<p>On arriving at Sibidooloo, Park related to the
mansa, or chief of the town, the misfortune which
had befallen him. This humane and excellent man,
having heard him patiently to an end, took the pipe
from his mouth, and tossing up the sleeve of his coat
with an indignant air, “Sit down,” said he, “you
shall have every thing restored to you; I have sworn
it.” He then took the necessary measures for the
recovery of the traveller’s property, and invited him
to partake of his hospitable fare until this should
have been effected. After spending a few days at
this place, without hearing any news of his horse or
other property, our traveller removed to a distant
village, where he remained until the whole was discovered
and restored to him, with the exception of
his pocket compass, which had been broken to pieces.
Having nothing else to bestow upon his hospitable
landlords, he gave his horse to one, and his saddle
and bridle to the other: and then taking his leave,
proceeded on foot to Kamalia. At this town, romantically
situated at the foot of a lofty mountain,
he found a slave-merchant, who, intending to descend
to the coast with a small caravan in the beginning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
of the dry season, offered our traveller an
asylum until he should set out. Conceiving that it
would be impossible to proceed during the rains,
Park accepted his kind proposal, and promised in
return to give him the price of a slave upon their
arrival on the coast. Here a fever, which had for
some time menaced him, manifested itself with great
violence, and continued to torment him during the
whole season of the rains. His landlord, meanwhile,
exerted himself to keep up his hopes, and having
by some means or another obtained possession of an
English Common Prayer Book, he communicated the
use of it to Park, who was thus enabled to beguile
the gloomy hours of his solitude and sickness. At
length the rains became less frequent, and the fever
abated, so that he could move out to enjoy the fresh
air in the fields.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April, Karfa, the slave-merchant,
having collected his slaves, and completed all necessary
preparations, set out towards the coast, taking
our traveller, to whom his behaviour had always
been marked by the greatest kindness, along with
him. Their road led them across a vast wilderness,
where the sufferings of every member of the caravan,
and more particularly of the slaves, were most
exquisite; but affliction was far from having taught
them commiseration, for a fine young female slave,
fainting from fatigue, had no sooner signified her
inability to go on, than the universal cry of the caravan
was, “cut her throat, cut her throat.” By the
interposition of Karfa her life was spared, but she
was abandoned on the road, where she was no doubt
soon devoured by wild beasts. At length, after a
long, toilsome journey, Karfa succeeded in fulfilling
his promise, and conducted our traveller safe to
Pisania, where the good old man was overwhelmed
with the gratitude of his guest. Park now took his
passage in an American vessel, and on arriving in
the West Indies, quitted this ship for a packet bound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
for Falmouth, where he arrived on the 22d of December,
1797, after an absence of two years and seven
months.</p>

<p>Immediately on his landing he hastened to London,
where he arrived before daylight on the morning
of Christmas-day. It being too early an hour
to call on his brother-in-law, Mr. Dickson, he strolled
about for some time in the neighbouring streets.
At length, finding one of the entrances into the gardens
of the British Museum accidentally open, he
went in and walked about there for some time. It
happened that Mr. Dickson, who had the care of
those gardens, went there early that morning on
some trifling business. What must have been his
emotions on beholding, at that extraordinary time
and place, the vision, as it must at first have appeared,
of his long lost friend, the object of so many
anxious reflections, and whom he had long numbered
with the dead.</p>

<p>He was now received with distinguished honour
by the African Association, and the various literary
men whom he met with in London. In the mean
time his travels, which the Association permitted
him to publish on his own account, were announced;
and both during his stay in London, and the visit
which he paid to his friends in Scotland, all his
leisure hours were devoted to the compiling and
arranging of the materials for the work. It appeared
in the spring of 1799, and immediately acquired that
degree of popularity which it has ever since maintained.
In the composition of his travels, however,
he was assisted by Bryan Edwards, author of a “History
of the West Indies,” an advocate of the slave-trade,
in deference to whom Park is said to have
suppressed his own opinions, which had a contrary
tendency. The apology offered for this mean compliance
is, that Bryan Edwards, being secretary to
the African Association, had it in his power greatly
to influence the future fortunes of our traveller. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
should prefer supposing that his arguments produced
a temporary conviction upon Park’s mind, unless
some more convincing proof than has yet been
brought forward could be adduced to substantiate
the accusation of so remarkable a deficiency of
moral courage in a man in whom, on all other occasions,
courage seemed to be the prevailing virtue.</p>

<p>However this may be, Park again returned to
Scotland soon after the publication of his travels,
where, on the 2d of August, 1799, he married one
of the daughters of Mr. Anderson, of Selkirk, with
whom he had served his apprenticeship. He now
seemed to have forgotten his ambitious feelings, and
for more than two years resided on the farm at
Fowlshiels, with his mother and one of his brothers.
He then removed to the town of Peebles, where he
resumed the practice of his profession, and seems,
in a short time, to have acquired a good share of the
business of the place. But it will easily be imagined
that the quiet obscure life of a country surgeon
could possess no charms for an ardent ambitious
mind like Park’s. He longed to be performing upon
some more stirring scene. In this dreary solitude,
therefore, where the indulgence of day-dreams
would appear to have been his principal amusement,
scheme after scheme seems to have presented itself
to his mind, each giving way in its turn to another
equally impracticable. At length he received, through
the medium of Sir Joseph Banks, intelligence that
the African Association were once more about to
send a mission into the interior of Africa, for the
purpose of penetrating to and navigating the Niger;
and that, in case government should enter into the
plan, he himself would certainly be recommended as
the person proper to be employed for carrying it
into execution.</p>

<p>Dilatoriness is too frequently the characteristic of
the proceedings of great public bodies. The first
idea of this new mission was conceived in 1801, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
it was not until the beginning of 1805 that the expedition
was ultimately determined on, when Park received
from Lord Camden his appointment as its
chief conductor. “For the better enabling you to
execute this service,” says his lordship, “his majesty
has granted you the brevet commission of
captain in Africa, and has also granted a similar
commission of lieutenant to Mr. Alexander Anderson,
whom you have recommended as a proper person
to accompany you. Mr. Scott has also been
selected to attend you as draughtsman. You are
hereby empowered to enlist with you for this expedition
any number you think proper of the garrison
at Goree, not exceeding forty-five, which the commandant
of that island will be ordered to place under
your command, giving them such bounties or encouragement
as may be necessary to induce them
cheerfully to join with you in the expedition.”</p>

<p>Five thousand pounds were at the same time
placed at Park’s disposal, and further directions
given him respecting the course and line of conduct
he was expected to pursue. With these instructions
Park and his companions proceeded to Portsmouth,
where they were joined by four or five artificers,
appointed for the service from the dock-yards. They
sailed on the 30th of January, and on the 28th of
April arrived at Pisania. Here they made preparations
for entering the interior. The party consisted
of forty men, two lieutenants, a draughtsman, a
guide, and Park himself. Their provisions and merchandise
were carried by asses, and they had horses
for themselves. Thus appointed, they left Pisania
on the 4th of May. It was very quickly discovered,
however, that their asses were unequal to the task
imposed upon them; some lay down, others kicked
off their burdens, and it became necessary to increase
the number of these vicious animals.</p>

<p>At Bady, a town in the interior frontier of Woolli,
they were led into a quarrel with the farauba, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
chief of the town, respecting the amount of duties to
be paid by their caravan, in which, though the conduct
of the African was rude and peremptory, the
travellers were clearly in the wrong. A few days
after this affair the caravan had an adventure with a
new species of enemy. On the 24th of May they
reached a place which they denominated Bee’s
Creek, where they halted with the intention of encamping
there. “We had no sooner unloaded the
asses at the creek,” says Park, “than some of
Isaaco’s people, being in search of honey, unfortunately
disturbed a large swarm of bees near where
the coffle had halted. The bees came out in immense
numbers, and attacked men and beasts at the
same time. Luckily, most of the asses were loose,
and galloped up the valley; but the horses and people
were very much stung, and obliged to scamper
in all directions. The fire which had been kindled
for cooking, having been deserted, spread and set
fire to the bamboos; and our baggage had like to
have been burnt. In fact, for half an hour the bees
seemed to have put an end to our journey.</p>

<p>“In the evening, when the bees became less
troublesome, and we could venture to collect our
cattle, we found that many of them were very much
stung and swelled about the head. Three asses
were missing; one died in the evening and one next
morning, and we were compelled to leave one at
Sibikillin; in all six: besides which, our guide lost
his horse, and many of the people were very much
stung about the face and hands.”</p>

<p>About the middle of June the rains began to set in,
accompanied by violent tornadoes. The earth was
quickly covered with water. The soldiers were affected
with vomiting, or with an irresistible inclination
to sleep. Our traveller himself was affected in
a similar manner during the storm, and, notwithstanding
that he used every exertion to keep away
heaviness, at length fell asleep on the damp ground.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
The soldiers did the same thing. In the morning
twelve of them were sick. In this vicinity he saw
many pits, from which gold was obtained in large
quantities by washing. As the caravan proceeded,
many of the soldiers growing delirious, or too weak
to continue the march, were left behind to the care
of the natives; while others died on the road, or
were drowned in the rivers. Some, still more unfortunate
if possible, were lost in the woods, where
they were no doubt devoured by wild beasts. Meanwhile
the natives, who imagined that the caravan
contained prodigious wealth, hung upon their march,
plundered them at every turn, and as often as they
appeared too weak to resist, endeavoured to extort
presents from them.</p>

<p>The condition of the men now became desperate.
Day after day some poor wretch was abandoned to
his fate, some in one way, some in another. I give
one example which may serve for the whole.
“Three miles east of the village of Koombandi,”
says Park, “William Alston, one of the seamen
whom I received from his majesty’s ship Squirrel,
became so faint that he fell from his ass, and allowed
the ass to run away. Set him on my horse, but
found he could not sit without holding him. Replaced
him on the ass, but he still tumbled off. Put
him again on the horse, and made one man hold him
upright while I led the horse; but, as he made no
exertion to hold himself erect, it was impossible to
keep him on the horse, and after repeated tumbles
he begged to be left in the woods till morning. I
left a loaded pistol with him, and put some cartridges
into the crown of his hat.”</p>

<p>In crossing the Wondu the caravan was nearly
deprived of its guide in the following manner:
“Our guide, Isaaco, was very active in pushing the
asses into the water, and shoving along the canoe;
but as he was afraid that we could not have them
all carried over in the course of the day, he attempted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
to drive six of the asses across the river farther
down, where the water was shallower. When he
had reached the middle of the river, a crocodile rose
close to him, and instantly seizing him by the left
thigh, pulled him under water. With wonderful
presence of mind he felt the head of the animal, and
thrust his finger into its eye, on which it quitted its
hold, and Isaaco attempted to reach the farther shore,
calling loudly for a knife. But the crocodile returned
and seized him by the other thigh, and again
pulled him under water; he had recourse to the
same expedient, and thrust his fingers into its eyes
with such violence that it again quitted him; when
it arose, flounced about on the surface of the water
as if stupid, and then swam down the middle of the
river. Isaaco proceeded to the other side, bleeding
very much.”</p>

<p>This event retarded for several days the march of
the caravan. Besides, Park himself was attacked
with fever, and their provisions, moreover, were now
reduced to so low an ebb, that upon examination it
was found that no more than rice for two days remained
in their possession. This deficiency was,
therefore, to be immediately supplied. Two persons
were sent away with an ass to a distant village for
rice, and in the mean time our traveller devoted his
attentions to the wounds of the guide. The sailor
who had been abandoned in the woods here rejoined
the caravan quite naked, having been robbed of his
clothes by the natives. The audacity of these
thieves was extraordinary. In ascending an eminence
two miles from Maniakono, Park himself was
robbed in a very characteristic manner:&mdash;“As I was
holding my musket carelessly in my hand, and looking
round,” says he, “two of Numma’s sons came
up to me; one of them requested me to give him
some snuff; at this instant the other (called Woosaba),
coming up behind me, snatched the musket
from my hand, and ran off with it. I instantly sprung
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
from the saddle and followed him with my sword,
calling to Mr. Anderson to ride back, and tell some
of the people to look after my horse. Mr. Anderson
got within musket-shot of him; but, seeing it was
Numma’s son, had some doubts about shooting him,
and called to me if he should fire. Luckily I did
not hear him, or I might possibly have recovered my
musket at the risk of a long palaver, and perhaps
the loss of half our baggage. The thief accordingly
made his escape among the rocks; and when I returned
to my horse, I found the other of the royal
descendants had stolen my coat.”</p>

<p>Their condition was now exceedingly distressing.
Not only the soldiers and sailors, but Scott and Anderson
began to lag behind, being attacked by fever,
the first effect of which in those countries is to deprive
the sufferer of his energies. Having remained
for some time by the wayside with his dying friend,
he placed him, when his strength appeared for a moment
to return, upon his horse, and pushed forward
towards their proposed halting-place, leading the
horse by the bridle. “We had not proceeded above
a mile,” says Park, “before we heard on our left a
noise very much like the barking of a large mastiff,
but ending in a hiss like the fuff<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of a cat. I thought
it must be some large monkey; and was observing
to Mr. Anderson, ‘What a bouncing fellow that must
be,’ when we heard another bark nearer to us, and
presently a third still nearer, accompanied with a
growl. I now suspected some wild beast meant to
attack us, but could not conjecture of what species
it was likely to be. We had not proceeded a hundred
yards farther, when, coming to an opening in
the bushes, I was not a little surprised to see three
lions coming towards us. They were not so red as
the lion I had formerly seen in Bambarra, but of a
dusky colour, like that of an ass. They were very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
large, and came bounding over the long grass, not
one after another, but all abreast of each other. I
was afraid, if I allowed them to come too near us,
and my piece should miss fire, that we should all be
devoured by them. I therefore let go the bridle, and
walked forwards to meet them. As soon as they
were within a long shot of me, I fired at the centre
one. I do not think I hit him; but they all stopped,
looked at each other, and then bounded away a few
paces, when one of them stopped and looked back
at me. I was too busy in loading my piece to observe
their motions as they went away, and was
very happy to see the last of them march slowly off
among the bushes. We had not proceeded above
half a mile farther when we heard another bark and
growl close to us among the bushes. This was,
doubtless, one of the lions before seen; and I was
afraid they would follow us till dark, when they
would have too many opportunities of springing
on us unawares. We however heard no more of
them.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>At length, from the brow of a hill, Park had once
more the satisfaction of beholding the Niger, rolling
its immense stream along the plain. But he was in
no mood of mind to triumph at the sight. The majority
of his companions had fallen on the way; of
thirty-four soldiers and four carpenters who left the
Gambia, only six soldiers and one carpenter reached
the Niger. With this miserable remnant of his
original force he descended the hill, and pitched his
tents near the town of Bambakoo. Here some of
the party embarked in canoes on the Niger, while
others proceeded by land to the neighbourhood of
Sego, which they reached on the 19th of September.
Mansong was still king of Bambarra; and being
highly gratified with their presents, not only gave
them permission to build a boat on the Niger at
whatever town they pleased, but engaged to protect,
as far as his power extended, the trade of the whites
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
in the interior. Park selected Sansanding as the
place most eligible for building the boat, and removed
thither as quickly as possible. Here immediately
on his arrival he opened a shop, exhibiting a choice
assortment of European goods, which sold so well
among the natives that his success excited the envy
of the Jinnic people, the Moors, and the other merchants
of the place, who offered Mansong merchandise
to a much greater value than the presents
made him by Park, if he would either kill the strangers
or drive them out of the country. Mansong,
however, rejected the offer. “From the 8th to the
16th nothing of consequence occurred; I found my
shop every day more and more crowded with customers;
and such was my run of business, that I
was sometimes forced to employ three tellers at
once to count my cash. I turned one market-day
twenty-five thousand seven hundred and fifty-six
pieces of money (cowries).”</p>

<p>Park now received intelligence of the death of
Mr. Scott, who had been left behind near Bambakoo.
Mansong very soon convinced the traveller that he
understood the art of receiving presents much better
than that of returning them; for upon being requested
to furnish a canoe in which the mission,
now reduced to a very small number, might embark
on the Niger, he sent one after another several half-rotten
barks; two of which Park, seeing no hope of
getting better, was at length compelled to accept,
and with these he constructed what he termed a
schooner. Shortly after this he lost his friend Anderson,
upon whose death “I felt myself,” says he,
“as if left a second time lonely and friendless amid
the wilds of Africa.” Dreary and perilous as was
his position, however, he still determined to persevere.
His companions were now reduced to four,
Lieutenant Martyn and three soldiers, one of whom
was deranged in his mind; yet with this wretched
remnant of a detachment which, it must be confessed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
had been thus thinned, or rather annihilated,
by his own ill management and want of foresight,
he purposed following the course of the Niger to its
termination, whether that should prove to be in
some great lake or inland sea, or, as he rather believed,
in the Atlantic Ocean. And this voyage,
says one of his biographers, one of the most formidable
ever attempted, was to be undertaken in a
crazy and ill-appointed vessel, manned by a few negroes
and a few Europeans!</p>

<p>On the 16th of November, having completed all
the necessary preparations for his voyage, our traveller
put the finishing hand to his journal; and in
the interval between that and his embarkation,
which seems to have taken place on the 19th, wrote
several letters to England. These letters, together
with the journal, were then delivered to his guide
Isaaco, by whom they were conveyed to the Gambia,
from whence they were transmitted to England;
after which nothing certain or authentic can be said
to have been heard either of Park or the expedition.
In 1806, however, vague accounts of the death of
Park and his companions were brought to the
British settlements on the coast by the native
traders from the interior; but several years elapsed
without any further intelligence being obtained. At
length, in 1810, Colonel Maxwell, governor of Senegal,
despatched Park’s guide, Isaaco, into the interior,
for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or
falsehood of the reports which prevailed, and, should
they prove correct, of collecting information respecting
the place and manner of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>After an absence of one year and eight months
Isaaco returned to Senegal, and delivered to the
governor a journal of his proceedings, including a
narrative which he had received from Amadi Fatouma,
the guide who accompanied Park from Sansanding
down the Niger. The particulars of Isaaco’s
adventures it is altogether unnecessary to describe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
He found Amadi Fatouma at Madina, a village distant
a few hours from Sansanding. On seeing
Isaaco, and hearing the name of Park, he began to
weep; and his first words were, “They are all dead.”
The recollection of the melancholy transaction appeared
to affect him in an extraordinary manner,
and it was with the utmost reluctance that he at
length consented to recall to memory an event which
he seemed peculiarly desirous of delivering over to
oblivion. However, upon the pressing entreaties of
Isaaco, he narrated circumstantially what had taken
place. Upon leaving Sansanding, there were, he
said, nine persons in the canoe; Park, Martyn, three
other white men, three slaves, and himself as their
guide and interpreter. They had proceeded but a
very little way down the river before they were
pursued and attacked by the Africans in canoes, particularly
in passing Timbuctoo, where a great number
of the natives were killed. Shortly after passing
Goronmo, they lost one white man by sickness.
They were now, therefore, reduced to eight; but as
each person had always fifteen muskets loaded and
ready for action, they were still formidable to their
enemies.</p>

<p>As Park had laid in a considerable quantity of provisions
previous to his leaving Sansanding, he was
enabled to proceed for several days without stopping
at any place, which is the only circumstance that
can account for his passing in safety through the
country of so many hostile nations. At length,
however, their wants compelled them to have some
communication with the shore. “We came,” says
Amadi Fatouma, “near a small island, and saw
some of the natives; I was sent on shore to buy
some milk. When I got among them, I saw two
canoes go on board to sell fresh provisions, such as
fowls, rice, &amp;c. One of the natives wanted to kill
me, and at last he took hold of me, and said I was
his prisoner. Mr. Park, seeing what was passing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
on shore, suspected the truth. He stopped the two
canoes and people; telling the latter, that if they
should kill me, or keep me prisoner on shore, he
would kill them all, and carry their canoes away
with him. Those on shore, suspecting Mr. Park’s
intentions, sent me off in another canoe on board;
they were then released: after which we bought
some provisions from them, and made them some
presents. A short time after our departure twenty
canoes came after us from the same place; on
coming near, they hailed, and said, ‘Amadi Fatouma,
how can you pass through our country without
giving us any thing?’ I mentioned what they had
said to Mr. Park, and he gave them a few grains of
amber and some trinkets, and they went back peaceably.
On coming to a narrow part of the river, we
saw on the shore a great many men sitting down;
coming nearer to them they stood up; we presented
our muskets to them, which made them run off into
the interior. A little farther on we came to a very
difficult passage. The rocks had barred the river,
but three passages were still open between them.
On coming near one of them, we discovered the same
people again, standing on the top of a large rock;
which caused great uneasiness to us, especially to
me, and I seriously promised never to pass there
again without making considerable charitable donations
to the poor. We returned, and went to a pass
of less danger, where we passed unmolested.</p>

<p>“We came-to before Carmassee, and gave the
chief one piece of baft. We went on, and anchored
before Gourman. Mr. Park sent me on shore with
forty thousand cowries to buy provisions. I went
and bought rice, onions, fowls, milk, &amp;c., and departed
late in the evening. The chief of the village
sent a canoe after us, to let us know of a large army
encamped on the top of a very high mountain, waiting
for us; and that we had better return, or be on
our guard. We immediately came to an anchor,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and spent there the rest of the day and all the night.
We started in the morning; on passing the abovementioned
mountain we saw the army, composed
of Moors with horses and camels, but without any
firearms. As they said nothing to us we passed on
quietly, and entered the country of Haoussa, and
came to an anchor. Mr. Park said to me, ‘Now,
Amadi, you are at the end of your journey: I engaged
you to conduct me here; you are going to
leave me; but before you go you must give me the
names of the necessaries of life, &amp;c., in the language
of the countries through which I am going to pass;’
to which I agreed, and we spent two days together
about it without landing. During our voyage I was
the only one who had landed. We departed, and
arrived at Yaour. I was sent on shore the next
morning with a musket and a sabre to carry to the
chief of the village; also with three pieces of white
baft for distribution. I went and gave the chief his
present: I also gave one to Alhagi, one to Alhagibiron,
and the other to a person whose name I forget;
all Marabons. The chief gave us a bullock, a
sheep, three jars of honey, and four men’s loads of
rice. Mr. Park gave me seven thousand cowries,
and ordered me to buy provisions, which I did; he
told me to go to the chief, and give him five silver
rings, some powder and flints, and tell him that these
presents were given to the king by the white men,
who were taking leave of him before they went
away. After the chief had received these things, he
inquired if the white men intended to come back.
Mr. Park, being informed of this inquiry, replied that
he could not return any more.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Mr. Park had paid
me for my voyage before we left Sansanding: I said
to him, ‘I agreed to carry you into the kingdom of
Haoussa; we are now in Haoussa. I have fulfilled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
my engagement with you; I am therefore going to
leave you here and return.’”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a>
These words occasioned his death; for the certainty of Mr. Park
not returning induced the chief to withhold the presents from the
king.</p>

</div>

<p>On the next day Park departed, leaving the guide
at the village of Yaour, where he was put in irons
by order of the king, from a supposition that he had
aided the white men in defrauding him of the customary
presents, which the chief of Yaour had in
fact received, but retained for himself. “The next
morning, early,” continues the guide, “the king sent
an army to a village called Boussa, near the river-side.
There is before this village a rock across the
whole breadth of the river. One part of the rock is
very high; there is a large opening in that rock in
the form of a door, which is the only passage for the
water to pass through; the tide current is here very
strong. This army went and took possession of the
top of this opening. Mr. Park came there after the
army had posted itself; he nevertheless attempted
to pass. The people began to attack him, throwing
lances, pikes, arrows, and stones. Mr. Park defended
himself for a long time; two of his slaves at
the stern of the canoe were killed; they threw every
thing they had in the canoe into the river, and kept
firing; but being overpowered by numbers, and
fatigued, and unable to keep up the canoe against
the current, and no probability of escaping, Mr. Park
took hold of one of the white men and jumped into
the water; Martyn did the same, and they were
drowned in the stream in attempting to escape.
The only slave remaining in the boat, seeing the natives
persist in throwing weapons at the canoe
without ceasing, stood up and said to them, ‘Stop
throwing now, you see nothing in the canoe, and
nobody but myself; therefore cease. Take me and
the canoe, but don’t kill me.’ They took possession
of the canoe and the man, and carried them to the
king.</p>

<p>“I was kept in irons three months; the king released
me, and gave me a slave (woman). I immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
went to the slave taken in the canoe, who
told me in what manner Mr. Park and all of them
had died, and what I have related above. I asked
him if he was sure nothing had been found in the
canoe after its capture; he said nothing remained in
the canoe but himself and a sword-belt. I asked
him where the sword-belt was; he said the king
took it, and had made a girth for his horse with it.”</p>

<p>Such is the narrative of Amadi Fatouma; and the
information since obtained in the country by Captain
Clapperton corroborates almost every important circumstance
which it describes. It appears, however,
that certain books (whether printed or manuscript
does not appear) were found in Park’s canoe, some
of which were still in the possession of the chief of
Yaour when Clapperton made his inquiries; but the
wily African, who no doubt expected a valuable
present for these relics, refused to deliver them to
our traveller’s messenger, and Clapperton himself,
for some reason or another not stated, neglected to
visit this chief in person. It should be remarked,
that the Africans who were questioned by Clapperton
seemed all exceedingly desirous of exculpating
their countrymen, perhaps their own friends and
relations, from the charge of having murdered Park
and his companions: according to one narrator, the
canoe was caught between two rocks, where the
river, being obstructed in its course, rushed through
its narrow channel with prodigious rapidity. Here
the travellers, in attempting to disembark, were
drowned in the sight of an immense multitude who
had assembled to see them pass, and were too timid
to attack or assist them. On another occasion,
however, the same person confessed that his countrymen
did indeed discharge their arrows at the
travellers, but not until they had been fired upon
from the canoe. But the sheriff of Bokhary, whose
letter was found among the MSS. of Clapperton,
asserts that the inhabitants of Boussa went out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
against the white men in great numbers, and attacked
them during three successive days; after
which Park and Martyn, who from this account
would appear to have been the only European survivors,
threw their papers and baggage into the
water, and leaping in after them were drowned in
the stream. It would answer no useful purpose to
push these inquiries any further at present, as we in
reality possess no sufficient materials for coming to
any definite conclusion. There can be no doubt that
Mungo Park perished on the Niger, near Boussa, or
that the Africans were the cause, mediate or immediate,
of his death. His character will be best understood
by a careful examination of his life; but it
may be useful to remark, in conclusion, that, although
his natural prudence seems partly to have forsaken
him during his second journey, few men have possessed
in a higher degree the virtues of a traveller&mdash;intrepidity,
enthusiasm, perseverance, veracity, prudence;
his manners, likewise, though somewhat too
stiff and reserved, must upon the whole have been
agreeable, since he was able both in civilized and
savage countries to gain and preserve many friends;
among whom by far the most distinguished was Sir
Walter Scott, with whom, during the interval between
his two journeys, he lived on terms of the
greatest intimacy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PETER_SIMON_PALLAS">PETER SIMON PALLAS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">Born 1741.&mdash;Died 1811.</p>

<p>This traveller, whose works are comparatively
little known in England, was born at Berlin, September
22, 1741. His father, who was an able surgeon,
entertained the design of educating him for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
his own profession; and at the same time caused
him to learn several languages. At a very early age
he was able, therefore, to write the Latin, the English,
the French, and the German. His retentive
memory rendered these acquirements so easy, that
his great success in this department of knowledge
scarcely at all interfered with his progress in others;
so that he is said to have likewise maintained among
his schoolfellows the pre-eminence in all their various
studies. He was, in fact, by no means satisfied
with what was taught him by his different masters,
but employed his leisure hours in the study of
natural history; and at the age of fifteen he had
already imagined ingenious divisions of several
classes of animals.</p>

<p>Having attended at Berlin the courses of Gleditsch,
Mekhel, and Roloff, and those of Vogel and Rœderer
at Göttingen, he proceeded to Leyden, to finish his
studies under Albinus, Gaubins, and Musschenbroeck.
The rarest productions of nature had been
for two centuries accumulating in Holland by the
commerce of the whole world; and it was therefore
impossible that the ardent passion of Pallas for
natural history should not be still further excited by
living in the midst of them. But perhaps we attribute
too much influence to the force of circumstances.
The soul, with all its tastes and passions,
is far more independent of external things than is
generally supposed. Concomitance is not causation.
The energy of the mind derives sustenance,
as it were, from circumstances; but the effect of
this nourishment is determined by its own original
character, just as it is determined by the innate
qualities of the scorpion, or the bee, whether the
vegetable juices which they extract from the plants
of the field shall be converted into poison or into
nectar. However this may be, Pallas afterward
visited England, where a commerce more extensive
than had ever been carried on by any other nation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
ancient or modern, must likewise have collected immense
treasures in natural history, which afforded
him a fortunate occasion for improving his knowledge.
The sight of these scientific riches seems,
in reality, to have determined him to waive all claim
to professional emolument or honours, for the purpose
of devoting himself entirely to natural history;
and he obtained his father’s permission to settle at
the Hague, with a view of continuing his studies.</p>

<p>Here, in 1776, he published his “Elenchus Zoophytorum,”
the first of his “great works,” to adopt the
expression of M. Eyriès, which, for an author of
twenty-five, was a remarkable performance. The
“Miscellanea Zoologica,” which was published the
same year, still further augmented his reputation.
This work (I still borrow the language of the French
geographer) threw a new light upon the least known
classes of the animal kingdom, those which had
hitherto been confounded together under the name
of worms. These two publications carried far and
wide the name of their author, and several governments
sought to monopolize his talents. He would
probably have given the preference to that of his
own country, had he received from it the least encouragement;
but, as too often happens, says M.
Cuvier, it was at home that he was least respected.
He therefore resolved to desert his country, and accepted
a place in the Academy of St. Petersburg,
which was offered him by Catherine II. Pallas’s
private circumstances are nowhere, so far as I have
been able to discover, properly explained. I know
not, therefore, whether extreme poverty or vulgar
cupidity determined him to take this step; but I
cannot, without pain, contemplate men of abilities
running about the world in search of wealth, ready
to snatch at it from any hand, and no less ready, however
base may be the donor, to repay the dishonourable
obligation by despicable flattery and adulation.
For this reason, in spite of the profound veneration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
with which I regard every thing like genius, which
appears to be a spark of the Divine nature fallen
from heaven, I cannot help considering Pallas as a
learned and ingenious slave, cringing at the foot of
power, and willing to perform all things at its
bidding.</p>

<p>Catherine, it is well known, was desirous that
some of her own barbarians should observe in Siberia
the transit of Venus over the sun’s disk in 1769,
and not, as in 1763, leave the honour to foreigners.
She therefore selected a number of astronomers
from the Academy of St. Petersburg, and joined
with them several naturalists, whose business it was
to examine the nature of the productions and soil
in this remote province of the empire. They were,
in fact, instructed to make the most exact researches
on the nature of the soil; on that of the waters;
on the means of cultivating the deserts; on the
actual state of agriculture; the diseases which
chiefly prevailed among men and beasts; the means
of curing or preventing them; the manner of rearing
bees, silkworms, and cattle; minerals, and mineral
waters; the arts, trades, and other industrious
processes of each province; the plants, animals,
the interior and the form of mountains; and, in
short, on all the objects of natural history. The
geography of the country, the manners of its inhabitants,
and the traditions and monuments of antiquity
were likewise included.</p>

<p>Such was the enterprise to engage in which Pallas
was invited into Russia. In the midst of the numerous
preparations required for so long and arduous
a journey, he found leisure to compose several new
works (for he possessed, and was vain of, a great
facility in writing), which, in the opinion of naturalists,
were full of interesting views; among others
he presented to the academy his famous memoir on
the bones of large quadrupeds discovered in Siberia,
in which he proves that the remains of elephants,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
rhinoceroses, buffaloes, and many other kinds of
animals now peculiar to the south, were found in
those northern regions.</p>

<p>The expedition was composed of seven astronomers
and geometricians, five naturalists, and several
pupils, who were to direct their course in various
directions over the immense country which they
were about to explore. Pallas left Petersburg on
the 21st of June, 1768. The great road to Moscow,
which traverses a part of Ingria, affords nothing
interesting either to the traveller or the naturalist.
Having passed Tosna, they entered a forest of pines
and birch-trees, where, owing to the marshy nature
of the soil, every spot which had been cleared of
wood swarmed with gadflies. He passed through,
but made no stay at Novogorod, and then pushed on
to Bronitzkoi. The river which passes through this
town abounds in salmon-trout, which descend from
the lake of Ilman, visible from the neighbouring
hill. The road here affords a view of several
ancient tombs, which our traveller did not pause to
examine.</p>

<p>At a short distance beyond Saisovo, he crossed
the Jemlin, in which pearl-muscles are found; and,
hurrying along impatiently, arrived at Moscow on
the 4th of July. This city, which had so often been
visited and described by others, possessed so few
attractions for him that he would willingly have
quitted it immediately; but his vehicles, shattered
by the badness of the roads, paved in some instances
with trees, and cracked by the heat of the sun, required
reparation; other causes of delay occurred,
and he was therefore detained here many days. To
amuse himself a little, and blunt the point of his
impatience, he made several short excursions in the
environs, where he was greatly struck at finding on
all sides numerous petrifactions of marine substances.
The river Moskwa produces an abundance
of marine sponges, with which the Russian women
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
rub their cheeks, instead of paint. Attempts were
even then making to raise the genuine rhubarb in
the environs of Moscow.</p>

<p>From this city he set out for Vlodimir. But little
care was then taken in Russia to provide travellers
with good horses, since even the members of this
expedition were sometimes scarcely able to proceed
on account of the badness of their beasts. Vlodimir,
formerly an extensive city, according to the traditions
of the country, is picturesquely situated upon
several small hills, and surrounded by cherry-orchards,
the produce of which is the chief means of
subsistence possessed by the inhabitants. At Kassinof
Pallas found the descendants of several Tartar
princes, who were now engaged in the fur trade, and
possessed of considerable riches. They were of
the Mohammedan religion, and were at that time
rebuilding a fallen mosque, by permission of the
government.</p>

<p>At a small village on the banks of the Oka he
saw a great number of goitres, whose deformity he
supposed to arise from the quality of the water.
On the banks of the Piana he found, in a small scattered
village, several descendants of the Mordwans,
who, having been converted to Christianity, had lost
almost all traces of their ancient manners. These,
according to Pallas, were at that time the filthiest
people in the Russian empire, which was a bold
thing to say; but they were good husbandmen, and
their women, though ugly, were exceedingly laborious,
which our traveller, no doubt, regarded as a
superior quality to beauty.</p>

<p>About the middle of September the cold was
already considerable, rain and snow were frequent,
and the severe frosts commenced. Having passed
the Soura, they entered into an immense forest,
where he observed wild cabbages on the banks of
the river. Here they saw the beehives of the Mordwans,
which were left all the winter in the forests
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
with a very slender covering; and, among their
flocks, several mules produced between the goat and
the sheep. The peasants of these woody districts
were principally employed in making tar. On the
22d of September they reached Simbirsk, on the
Volga, where they were detained within doors for
some days by a tremendous storm. They then
issued forth upon their various pursuits; and, among
other places, Pallas visited the sulphurous springs
which are found near the Sargout. One of those
springs was formerly of considerable extent, and
furnished large quantities of sulphur, but it had then
disappeared. The other formed a little marsh on
the left bank of the stream. Even in the depth of
winter, the water of the spring never froze, and at
all times a thin sulphury vapour hung like a light
cloud over its surface.</p>

<p>The season being now too far advanced to allow
them to proceed on their journey, they determined
to pass the winter at Simbirsk, from whence they
departed on the following March towards Siberia.
In fact, they were weary of their residence at Simbirsk
long before the winter was over; and Pallas,
having been given a charming picture of the environs
of Samara, removed thither with his companions on
sledges. Near this town, in the bed of a small
stream which falls into the Sviaga, were found numerous
remains of the skeletons of elephants, among
which were several tusks very slightly injured by
time, from the ivory of which various beautiful articles
were wrought. Here our traveller continued
during the whole month of April, in which time
he examined whatever was remarkable in the environs;
and then, on the 2d of May, proceeded towards
the south, to Sizran on the Volga.</p>

<p>The heat at this place during almost the whole of
May was nearly insupportable; the clouds gathered
together, and, extending themselves in a thick canopy
over the sky, appeared to promise rain, while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the thermometer continued rising from 105 to 110
degrees in the shade; so that, in a place situated in
the same latitude as Caernarvon in North Wales, a
heat equal to that of Calcutta in July was experienced
in the spring. So high a temperature of the
atmosphere was probably unusual, as it alarmed the
peasantry for their crops; and processions, offering
up solemn prayers for rain, were beheld throughout
the country.</p>

<p>Proceeding thence towards Perevoloka, our traveller
beheld on the way a village which on the evening
before his arrival had been nearly unroofed by a
hurricane. The vast chalky plains on the banks of
the Volga had now been almost entirely stripped of
vegetation by the sun, and the heat in those places
which were bare of trees was tremendous. At the
foot of a small range of hills which traverse these
stepps Pallas conjectured that the vine would succeed
admirably. On drawing near the Volga they
found numerous lofty hills, some of which were exceedingly
well wooded, while barrenness dwelt upon
the others; and the narrow defiles which divided
them were filled with tarantula-holes, and the burrows
of the marmot, which was seen sitting at the
mouth of its retreat uttering piercing cries.</p>

<p>On a solitary spot at a short distance from the
Volga Pallas visited a large tomb, which he found
had formerly been opened by avaricious treasure-seekers;
but their excavations, like the tomb itself,
were now covered with a thick underwood, and were
therefore of ancient date. The excursions of our
traveller in various directions from Samara, which
was his head-quarters, were numerous, and his discoveries
in natural history would seem to have been
no less so; but he passed from place to place with
the utmost safety and despatch, as we travel from
London to Bath; and therefore, however valuable
may have been his scientific labours, the events of
one day too nearly resembled those of the preceding
not to cause the utmost monotony in his history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Near Bouzoulouk, on the river Samara, were found
numerous ancient tombs resembling those of the
Grecian heroes on the shores of the Hellespont.
Copper or golden-headed arrows were sometimes
found on opening these burrows; and on one occasion
the treasure-seekers were rewarded by the discovery
of a chain of gold round the neck of a skeleton.
The bones of the dead indicated a gigantic
stature. On arriving at one of the principal fortresses
on the line of the Jaik, Pallas visited the
Bashkir and Kalmuc camps, where he was amused
with a concert in the old national style. The songs
of the Kalmucs, like those of more refined nations,
were chiefly of love. Their instruments, though
rude, were not unpleasing. They likewise exhibited
their strength in the wrestling-ring, and their dexterity
in the use of the bow. The Bashkirs also
displayed their skill in archery, and danced several
Tartar dances. Here Pallas observed the largest
marsh-flies he had ever seen,&mdash;six inches in length
by three and a half in breadth. In travelling along
the Jaik it was found necessary to move under the
protection of an escort of Cossacks, as the Kirghees,
a hostile nation, were encamped in groups along the
banks of the river. On the 1st of July, 1769, he
arrived at Orenburg.</p>

<p>In this city our traveller enjoyed an opportunity
of observing the manners of the Kirghees. These
people purchased annually from the Russians a number
of golden eagles, used by their hunters in the
chase of the wolf, the fox, and the gazelle, and would
sometimes give a horse in exchange for one of these
birds, while others were hardly valued at a sheep,
or even a small piece of money. During his stay at
Orenburg he visited the great salt-mines of Hetzkain,
and learned the laborious and ingenious methods
by which the fossil salt is extracted from the
bowels of the earth. The mines are chiefly worked
in summer, and the salt, being left to accumulate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
until the winter months, is then transported to distant
places by the peasantry. In these solitary
regions he saw a caravan of thirty camels returning
from China, having crossed the vast deserts of Central
Asia, where both men and animals had nearly
perished for want, in consequence of the excessive
heat of the summer. From thence he proceeded to
the Jasper Mountains, where many stones were found
beautifully variegated; some representing, when
split, the figures of trees upon their surfaces, while
others were dotted with spots of different colours.
On the summits of these mountains he beheld numerous
Kirgheesian tombs constructed with prodigious
blocks of jasper, with more than imperial magnificence.</p>

<p>From Orenburg he descended along the course of
the Jaik, through a mountainous country, intersected
by numerous ravines, and of a wild, desolate aspect.
Near Kalmikova, on the eastern shore of the Jaik,
he saw a Kirghees camp. When the party drew
near, about the close of the day, the Kirghees
seemed terrified at their approach; but were soon
reassured upon observing their pacific disposition.
They then crowded round them with joyful faces,
and, bringing forth their koumiss, or prepared mare’s
milk, enabled several of Pallas’s attendants to steep
their senses in forgetfulness. Still, our honest travellers,
conscious, perhaps, that the Kirghees had
some injuries to revenge against the Russians, were
fearful of passing the night in the camp, and therefore
hastened to return before dark to the city.
Thence he continued proceeding in a southern direction
to the ruins of Sarai, of which the ditch and the
rampart are nearly all that now remain. It sunk
gradually with the decay of the Tartar power, until
the inhabitants at length emigrated to Chiva, and
allowed it to fall entirely. The road from thence to
Gourief, on the Caspian, lies over a dry marsh,
where nothing but a few red wild-flowers meet the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
eye. Here Pallas embarked in a boat with a Mons.
Euler, in order to visit a small island in the Caspian,
the waters of which were of a grayish green, though
the sailors assured them that the colour farther out
at sea was a greenish black. It was said, that during
summer phosphoric fires were occasionally beheld
upon its waves.</p>

<p>Having examined the embouchure of the Jaik, and
the neighbouring coast of the Caspian Sea, Pallas
returned northward, and set up his quarters for the
winter of 1769 at Oufa, situated on the river Belaia.
Here he employed the time not spent in travelling
in working up his journal. The winter unfortunately
happened to be peculiarly bad; and this, united with
the melancholy situation of the city, and the bad air
which prevails there, prevented him from deriving
all the advantages which might have been expected
from so long a residence. To increase the dulness
and insipidity of his stay, he was kept almost a prisoner
in the city until the month of May by continual
inundations. In all other respects, likewise, the
winter was unfavourable. It commenced with September,
and continued increasing in rigour until the
end of November, when they were visited by terrible
tempests, in which several travellers perished
on the downs of Orenburg. These continued during
the whole of December. January was less severe,
and February mild. The winter ended in March,
the thaw commenced with April, and then the country
was overflowed.</p>

<p>Pallas had passed so unpleasant a winter at Oufa,
that he saw the time of departure approach with the
greatest satisfaction; and, as soon as the overflowing
of the rivers had ceased, despatched a soldier
before him across the Ural Mountains into the province
of Isetsk, with orders to cause the roads and
bridges to be repaired. He himself followed on the
16th of May. The weather, notwithstanding the
advanced season of the year, was overcast and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
stormy, with a north-west wind; it hailed, snowed,
and rained at intervals; but this did not continue
long. In the course of the day he passed by a vast
chasm, formed by the sliding of strata from their
basis, and by the inhabitants denominated “the bottomless
pit.” Here the people had three years before
cast the carcasses of all those animals which
had died of the murrain, which brought thither a
prodigious number of famished and furious wild dogs,
and thus rendered the road so dangerous that it was
found necessary to send out an armed detachment
against them.</p>

<p>The road now entered an immense forest, in
which the Russians, in imitation of the Bashkirs,
kept great numbers of beehives, which were hollowed
out in the trunks of large trees, about five or
six fathoms from the ground. This is intended as
one of the means of protecting the hives against the
bears; for which purpose they likewise carefully cut
off all the lower branches of the tree, and smooth
every knot. However, as the bear is too able a
climber to be thus discouraged, they, in addition to
these common precautions, fix a kind of circle of
sharp knives or scythes round the tree, a little below
the hive, which either prevents the animal from
ascending, or impales him when he would return.
But there are some old bears too experienced to be
thus caught, who strike out the spikes with their
paws. Against these other means are resorted to.
In the first place, they fix a kind of catapult aloft on
the tree, with a cord suspended, which, when the
animal touches, an arrow is darted down with great
vehemence, which transfixes him in the breast. Another
method is, to suspend a plank horizontally on
some of the long branches by cords, in such a manner
that it can be drawn at will before the mouth of
the hive, to which it is fastened by a knot of pliable
bark. Upon this plank the bear seats himself in
order to work at the hive. He then commences by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
loosening the knot, upon which the plank becomes
what boys call a “see-saw;” and the bear is either
precipitated in a moment to the ground, where he is
impaled upon sharp stakes fixed there for the purpose,
or, if he does not fall, he is compelled to leap,
or wait trembling on the plank until the owner of
the hive arrives and shoots him at his ease.</p>

<p>Having traversed the country of the Moursalarki
Bashkirs, our traveller visited a small volcano,
around which every thing was in full flower and further
advanced than elsewhere, on account of the
internal heat. This volcano was not of ancient date.
Many persons then living remembered the storm
during which a thunderbolt fell upon a great pine-tree,
which, taking fire and burning rapidly to the
very roots, kindled the mountain, which had thenceforward
continued on fire. The neighbouring forests
were wholly consumed by the conflagration. At this
time the fire seemed to have retired into the centre
of the mountain, where it raged with prodigious violence,
occasionally bursting forth through the wide
fissures of the superincumbent crust, which it was
gradually calcining to powder. The view of the volcano
during a stormy night was sublime. Broad
openings or cracks, commencing at the summit of
the cone, spread themselves like the veins of a leaf
down the side, branching forth in many directions,
as from a trunk; and these, contrasted with the dark
mass of the mountain, and emitting light-red flames
through all their extent, appeared like so many perpetual
streams of lightning in a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>In traversing a forest in this district after a terrible
hurricane, Pallas found the ground strewed with
small branches of poplar, the extremities of which
furnish a finer and more silky cotton than that of
Egypt or Bengal. Whether the Russian government
has ever attended to the suggestion of this
naturalist, in substituting this cotton for the ordinary
species, I have not been able to learn. The route
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
through the forests and mountains which border the
Aural in this direction was by no means very pleasing.
Pallas loved smooth roads, good inns, and good
dinners. He was therefore particularly annoyed
when, in making towards a mountain said to abound
in aluminous slate, he found his guide at fault in the
woods, where, after wandering about for some time,
they were overtaken by a tempest. The sky suddenly
grew dark, and their way lying among rugged
rocks of enormous magnitude, the passage between
which was frequently blocked up by trees which the
hurricane had overthrown, their horses refused to
proceed. Besides, the darkness was now so great
that they could not see before them, and it was
therefore necessary to pass the night where they
were. To make their lodgings as comfortable as
they could, they selected the tops of the highest
rocks, which were somewhat drier than the rest of
the forest. Had they possessed a tinder-box, it
would have been easy to kindle a fire, by which they
might have dried and warmed themselves; but our
traveller, like Sir Abel Handy in “Speed the Plough,”
whose inventions were never completed by the hour
of need, had left his tinder-box behind him. He endeavoured
to remedy this evil by rubbing together
two small pieces of wood; but the rain had damped
the seeds of fire which they contained, and he rubbed
in vain. Relinquishing at length all attempts to inveigle
Vulcan into their company, they erected a
small tent with the branches of trees and their
cloaks, and throwing themselves, wet as they were,
upon the felt of their saddles, in this manner quietly
passed the night, though the rain fell in torrents on
all sides. Next morning, after drinking a little water,
which served them for breakfast, they pushed
on through the woods; but as the rain still continued,
they were for a considerable time unable,
with all their exertions, to restore warmth to their
limbs. In the afternoon, however, they discovered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
an iron-foundry, where they dried their garments,
and then set forward on their return to their quarters.
This was destined to be a day of adventures
for Pallas. The river Aï, which they had crossed
without difficulty the day before, was now swelled
to a furious torrent by the rains; so that a ferry-boat
was indispensable. A horde of Chouvashes, who
inhabited the banks of the stream, undertook to construct
a boat; but when it was launched, and the
traveller embarked in it, the mariners discovered
that the cords by which it was to be pulled along
were so awkwardly arranged that they were every
moment in danger of being capsized and hurled into
the water. Fortunately, the rapidity of the current
was so great, that they darted along like an arrow,
clinging to their carriage, which they had had the
prudence to fasten with strong cords to the boat;
and in a moment they were on the opposite shore,
where the sharp angles of their raft, for it was little
better, struck in the earth, and prevented all possibility
of a refluence into the river. They then
dragged their vehicle on shore, and continued their
journey.</p>

<p>Proceeding eastward from this place, they arrived
on the 20th of June at the Asbestos Mountain, which
traverses a marshy region covered with moss. The
asbestos is found on the summit of the loftiest hill
in the whole chain, in a kind of coarse slate. It is
brittle, like decayed wood, while in the stone, but upon
being exposed to the air becomes soft and pliable as
flax, and is easily spun and woven into cloth. Pallas
himself, who carefully examined its nature and qualities,
as well as the mine, if it may be so termed,
from which it is drawn, saw it manufactured into
paper. From this place he proceeded to the iron-forges
of Sisertskoï, in the neighbourhood of which
gold is found in a matrix of quartz and ochre; and,
indeed, all the country immediately north of this
point abounds in an auriferous ochre, from which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
much pure metal might be extracted. He then visited
various other forges, mines, and quarries, and
arrived at Ekaterinburg on the 23d of June.</p>

<p>Our traveller’s life, like the peaceful periods of
history complained of by Plutarch, was too uniform
to furnish many interesting events to his biographer.
He travelled, he examined many things, he wrote;
but dangers, difficulties, and all the fierce play of the
passions, which render the life of a bold adventurer
who relies on his own resources a series of romantic
achievements, have no existence in his travels’
history, and both the reader’s patience and mine are,
therefore, somewhat irritated. This, no doubt, may
appear unphilosophical to many. It may be said,
that when we behold the picture of a life, whether
individual or national, which flowed along in a calm
tide, unruffled by misfortune or vicissitude, our feelings
should be lulled into the same tranquil motion,
and be productive of a happiness similar to that, the
representation of which we contemplate. I have
faith in the wisdom of nature, which has ordered
things otherwise. The mind, when in a healthy and
vigorous state, abhors an uninterrupted calm; and
storms, hurricanes, and thunders are not more conducive
to the general good of the physical world
than vicissitudes, transitions, dangers, escapes, which
are the storms and sunshine of life, are conducive to
happiness in the individual who undergoes them,
and to sympathy and pleasure in those who contemplate
his career. For this reason, persons who
travel with authority never inspire us with the same
respect as those whose movements are spontaneous
and independent; nor can such travellers ever penetrate
like the latter into the core of manners and
national character, since most of those who approach
them put on, in deference to their very authority,
an artificial, deceptive appearance. In the same
manner, a nation which should begin and end in
peace would have no history; none, at least, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
could interest any one beyond its borders. Human
virtues are plants which never strike a deep root
unless shaken by misfortune. Virtue consists in
the directing of our intellectual and physical energies
to a praiseworthy end; but if our energies be
naturally feeble, or dwindle and wither away through
lack of exercise, our virtue, by a necessary consequence,
must become dwarfish and insignificant, and
utterly incapable of exciting enthusiastic sympathy
in those who behold its meek and timid bearing.</p>

<p>These reflections have been extorted from me by
the insipid mode of travelling adopted by Pallas.
Nothing can be further from my intention than to
recommend or require foolhardiness in a traveller;
but it seems not irrational to expect, that when a
man undertakes the task of examining a remote
country, he should be willing to incur some risk and
fatigue in the execution of his plan. Of fatigue Pallas,
perhaps, endured his share; but he seems to
have shrunk rather too timidly from coming in contact
with barbarous nations; and I therefore greatly
distrust the completeness of his moral pictures. On
the other hand, his descriptions of plants, minerals,
and the processes of Russian industry are exceedingly
minute, and enjoy, I believe, among scientific
men the reputation of being exact; but these, unfortunately,
the very nature of biography compels me
to reject, or introduce into the narrative but sparingly.
Among the curious things observed in the
western districts of Siberia was the method of preparing
Russia leather, which, though tanned in the
ordinary manner, acquired the fine scent which renders
it so valuable from the oil extracted from the
bark of the birch-tree. In traversing the forests
which surround the marble quarries on the banks
of the Toura, with Vogoul guides, they were overtaken
by the night. Excepting the small spot on
which they halted, all around was a marshy swamp
encumbered with wood, and affording neither road
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
nor pathway. They therefore considered themselves
fortunate in having found a dry resting-place;
and the Vogouls, to whom such accidents were familiar,
immediately occupied themselves in kindling
a fire at once, in order to procure warmth and keep
off the bears. Next morning his guides undertook
to conduct him, by a short path across the forest, to
the banks of the Liala, and accordingly struck off
boldly into the wilderness. The sombre pine-trees,
intermingling their branches above, rendered the
way exceedingly obscure; a bog or a fallen tree
every moment intercepted their route; the branches
of prickly shrubs tore their hands and faces; and
not a step could be taken without carefully observing
whether it might not precipitate them into some
impassable morass. Not a plant met the eye but the
<i>mœringia</i> and the <i>linnea</i>, two plants which our traveller,
in general a patient forbearing man, often saluted
with Tristram Shandy’s whole chapter of
curses, as they were in those northern regions the
never-failing forerunners of a swamp or an impervious
pine-forest. After much toil they reached an
open space, from which the trees had been cleared
away by a conflagration, which Pallas attributed to
lightning, and his guides to the frolics of the devil,
who, they imagined, during some long winter night
had kindled a whole forest to light up his gambols.
Shortly afterward, his guides, who had probably bestowed
too many of their thoughts upon the devil,
entirely lost their way, and, after floundering about
in bogs and woods for several hours, were compelled
to confess their utter ignorance of the way; upon
which, at the command of our traveller, they turned
back, and regained the point from which he had
started. The Vogouls, with whom he performed
this unsuccessful journey, are a people of primitive
and peculiar manners, living in separate families
scattered through the woods, with each its domain
and enclosure of several miles, containing elks and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
other large game. Though surrounded by marshes,
they are said to enjoy excellent health. Their lives,
however, are not of long duration. Short in stature,
and effeminate in form, they in some measure resemble
the Kalmucs, but their complexion is fairer.
Their women are handsome, and of exceedingly
amorous temperament. They profess Christianity,
but merely for peace’ sake; for in secret they continue
the worship of idols, which are daily invoked
with prayer and sacrifice.</p>

<p>About the end of August Pallas arrived at Cheliabinsk,
where he was for a considerable time confined
to his chamber by an affection of the eyes. Here,
therefore, he resolved to remain during the winter;
but, in order that no time might be lost, he despatched
a number of his attendants in various directions,
with orders to collect information. Growing tired
of this town about the middle of December, however,
he set out for Tobolsk, where he remained but
a few days, and then returned by Ekaterinburg to
Cheliabinsk, where he continued during the remainder
of the winter.</p>

<p>Pallas remained at Cheliabinsk until the 16th of
April, 1771, when, having commissioned a number
of the young men who accompanied the expedition
to examine the more northern portions of Siberia,
he departed towards the east. The day before he
set out, the long grass on the extensive downs to
the north of the city were set on fire; the flames
swept rapidly along the plains, and the wind blowing
towards the town, there was some danger that this
irresistible conflagration, which already embraced
the whole extent of the horizon, might reach the
place, and consume it to ashes. A timely shower
of rain, however, put an end to their apprehensions.</p>

<p>In proceeding towards the Tobol, our traveller was
alarmed by a report that the Kirghees were making
an incursion into the interjacent territory, and prudently
turned out of his way to avoid an encounter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
with these rude barbarians. At Kaminskaia several
of his companions fell sick, some with fever, some
with scorbutic rheumatism, while others became a
prey to melancholy. His movements, for these
reasons, were slow. The weather, meanwhile, was
exceedingly severe; the snow falling heavily, accompanied
by cold wind. The last days of April
were marked by a terrible hurricane, and May was
commenced with hard frost; notwithstanding which,
neither the young flowers nor the buds suffered any
particular injury. On the 2d of May one of his attendants
died of scurvy, which had afflicted him for
five months, and was accompanied by symptoms no
less violent than those which attend the same disorder
at sea. This event, which would have cost
some men a tear, seems to have given no particular
uneasiness to Pallas, who, leaving some of his people
to inter the dead, coolly continued his journey.</p>

<p>On reaching the stepp of Ischimi, he found an immense
plain watered by extensive lakes, and abounding
in aquatic game, among which the most remarkable
was a large species of white heron. To study
the manners of this bird he remained here a few
days. But his mode of procuring game was somewhat
different from that of Le Vaillant, who pursued
the birds into the woods, observed them in
their native haunts, and shot them himself. Pallas
despatched a number of subaltern naturalists, who
shot the game for him, and furnished him with an
account of their manners; and this was what he
termed studying natural history.</p>

<p>On arriving at Omsk, he applied to the temporary
governor of the town for permission to examine the
collection of maps of Siberia, as divided into provinces
and districts, which had been made by the
late Governor Springer; but the new functionary,
“dressed in a little brief authority,” had the ambition
to play the politician and statesman, and, notwithstanding
that he knew Pallas to be travelling for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
government upon a public mission, refused him the
favour he demanded without an express order from
court. Nay, when he desired to depart, this new
great man, with the prudence of an owl, denied him
a proper passport, though without this it would be
difficult for him to obtain horses on the way. Pallas,
however, with the caution of a courtier, rather
than with the honest indignation of a man of letters,
instead of stigmatizing this gross misconduct as it
deserved, merely observes, that he attributed it to
the military spirit naturally inimical to the sciences.</p>

<p>Our traveller at length departed from Omsk, and
commenced his examination of the productions found
on the banks of the Irtish, where, on digging in the
sandy downs, the bones of elephants and of many large
fishes were discovered. Though it was now drawing
near the end of May, he experienced continual
storms, sometimes accompanied by black clouds, at
others by a clear sky. From the inhabitants, however,
he learned that tempests succeed each other
almost unceasingly in those regions, where a week
of fine weather is seldom or never known. He here
learned from the fur-merchants a secret which deserves
to be generally known: in order to preserve
their furs from the worms, they tied up in each bale
several calamus roots, which, they asserted, were
an unfailing defence of their merchandise. A few
shreds of Russia leather, which preserves books
and papers from the moth even in Hindostan,
would no doubt have answered the same purpose.</p>

<p>On the 11th of June, while travelling through a
country thickly intersected with salt-lakes and birch
forests, and peopled by myriads of wild bees, he encountered
an enormous wolf, which was chasing a
duck upon the heath. This animal, he says, is generally
remarkable for its timidity in summer; but
on the present occasion seemed disposed, like one
of La Fontaine’s wolves; to enter into a debate with
the strangers; for, instead of flying, he coolly stood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
still to look at them, without being in the least disturbed
by their shouting. At length, however,
despairing of entering into any thing like rational
conversation with persons who seemed resolved to
monopolize all the privilege of good company for
themselves, he turned round upon his heel, and with
a disdainful and careless bound, continued his journey.</p>

<p>At the foot of the small mountains which branch
northward of the Altaïc chain, Pallas discovered a
prodigious number of excavations and pits, made at
some remote period by a people now unknown, who
understood the art of smelting metals, but who have
left no trace of their existence save these mines, and
the ornaments of copper and gold which are found
in their tombs. Here, at the small town of Shoulba,
our traveller was attacked with dysentery; but it
was necessary to push forward, though his weakness
was such that he could scarcely step into his carriage.
While in this state he passed by, but could
not visit, a tomb of prodigious magnitude, situated
on the summit of a lofty mountain, which, according
to tradition, had formerly been opened by a band of
one hundred and fifty armed peasantry, who had
been rewarded for their labour by the discovery of
fifty pounds weight of solid gold. A few days afterward
his dysentery became so violent that he was
compelled to discontinue his journey, and confine
himself, during several weeks, to his bed.</p>

<p>As soon as his health was a little improved, he set
out with M. Sokoloff, in order to visit the Altaïc
mountains. The whole of the neighbouring districts
are diversified with hill and dale, and watered by numerous
streams, which come down from the mountains,
foaming and thundering over their rocky beds.
On some of these eminences were found extensive
copses of raspberry-bushes, around which Pallas observed
the fresh tracks of bears, which are very fond
of this fruit, and not unfrequently carry off women
and children who resort thither to gather it. Apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
this is done merely as a frolic, or by way of
terrifying interlopers from meddling with their property;
for our traveller gravely observes that they
do them no manner of injury.</p>

<p>At length they discovered the summits of the
Altaï, covered with snow, and towering far above
everything around them. Pallas had no eye for the
picturesque. What in the eyes of another man
would have been sublime was to him merely fearful
and horrible; but he was struck with these cones,
and pyramids, and precipices, and prodigious pinnacles
of rock, which, when he beheld them, appeared
to support a black roof of clouds, which stretched
over the whole hemisphere, and menaced the country
with a second deluge. No marine petrifactions, or
any sign of their ever having been submerged in the
ocean, were here discoverable; but it is probable
that more careful researches would have been productive
of a different result.</p>

<p>From the Altaïc mountains Pallas directed his
course towards the north, crossed the Obi, traversed
the governments of Kolyran, visited Tomsk, and on
the 10th of October arrived at Krasnoiarsk, a city
situated on the Yeniseï, in the 66th degree of north
latitude. Here he set up his quarters for the winter.
The autumn, he observes, is generally mild in the
southern parts of Siberia; but with the winter storms
and hurricanes come on, and sometimes blow during
a whole month without intermission. The cold is
intense. Nevertheless, about the middle of February
the sun begins to exert considerable power, and
sensibly diminishes the snow on the mountains.</p>

<p>On the 7th of March, 1772, Pallas departed from
Krasnoiarsk for the eastern part of Siberia, accompanied
by a painter, and three naturalists. Their
route, as far as the Angora, lay through a country
partly covered with forests, where there falls, during
winter, large quantities of snow. From time to time
they observed the encampments of the idolatrous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
tribes who inhabit those regions, and roam about
like wild animals in the woods. They reached
Irkutsk on the 14th, and having remained a week in
that capital, continued their journey along the shores
of Lake Baikal. The weather had now grown warm,
and they saw the last flocks of alpine larks and
black sparrows, flying round the city, and then departing
for the north; these were followed by a species
of striped crow, which had passed the winter in the
warm regions of Mongolia, or China, and was now
pursuing the same route towards the arctic circle.</p>

<p>As our traveller was desirous of crossing Lake
Baikal on sledges, he hurried his departure from
Irkutsk, lest the warm weather should melt the ice,
and obstruct his passage. The scenery on the shores
of this immense lake is exceedingly rugged and
sublime. Rocks of vast elevation form the shores
of the Angara, by which you descend from Irkutsk to
the sea; and on arriving at the mouth of the river
you discover, as through an arcade, the vast basin
of the Baikal, and the lofty mountains which confine
its waters on the east. They directed their course
in a straight line from a small post on the bank of
the frozen stream, towards the borders of the lake,
pursuing their way in sledges on the ice. When
they had proceeded about half-way, they were overtaken
by a tremendous storm from the north-west,
which entirely cooled the atmosphere. The wind
swept along the ice with such prodigious violence,
that the sledge-drivers, who ran along by the side
of the vehicles, were sometimes blown away to the
distance of many fathoms from the road, and were
compelled to stick their knives in the ice, to prevent
their being carried away, and hurled into some chasm.
To avoid the risk of such accidents, the party halted
until the tempest was over.</p>

<p>At Zimovia on the Baikal, they found several persons
setting out to hunt the sea-dog on the lake.
This kind of chase takes place principally in April.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
The sea-dogs, assembling on those parts of the shore
where rapid streams or warm springs keep up an
opening in the ice, then ascend from the water, in
order to lie down upon the ice, and sleep in the sun.
The hunters fix up in their little sledges a small
white flag, which the dogs take for ice, and accordingly
are not frightened until they draw near and
fire upon them.</p>

<p>Pallas now descended in his sledge upon the
Baikal, and commenced this singular portion of his
journey. The ice had this winter been as smooth
as a mirror, on the whole surface of the lake; but
when they had advanced to a certain distance from
the shore, they found a fissure of several feet in
breadth, which intercepted their passage, and forced
them to make a circuit of considerable length.
However, this obstacle having been surmounted,
they encountered no other, and quickly found themselves
on the opposite shore. The road now assumed
a different character, running over rugged mountains,
or sandy flats, where the snow was entirely
melted, until, cutting the Selinga, as it were, into two
parts, it led them into a milder climate, where the
spring, with all its gay accompaniments, was already
far advanced. They arrived, much fatigued, at Selinginsk,
on the 25th of March.</p>

<p>From Selinginsk he proceeded through Mongolia
towards the borders of China, moving among an
idolatrous people, the partisans of the Lamaic hierarchy,
until, arriving at Kiakter, he touched the extreme
limits of the empire, where his journey in that
direction was to terminate. Here Pallas made many
inquiries respecting the commerce, opinions, and manners
of the Chinese; and having satisfied his curiosity,
returned to Selinginsk. From this point he now
directed his course northward, towards the great
tributary streams which fall into the Selinga. His
excursions in this direction, which were carried into
execution without enthusiasm or curiosity, merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
as a task imposed on him by authority, are still more
destitute of incidents, if possible, than the former
portion of his travels. He examined the iron-mines,
the grain and fur trade, and the objects of natural
history furnished by the district.</p>

<p>Pallas now turned his face towards the east, traversed
the desert regions which lie between the
Selinga and the Onon, the principal branch of the
Amoor, and having pushed his researches to within
a very short distance of the Chinese frontier, returned
by a different route to Selinginsk, leaving to
M. Sokolof and others the honour of exploring the
frontiers of Mongolia, along the banks of the Argoon
and Amoor. His health, indeed, now began to suffer
from constant fatigue, and he was therefore fully
justified in relinquishing this portion of his task;
but I cannot easily pardon him for pretending to have
been actuated by the desire of botanizing on the banks
of the Selinga, since, if botanizing was his object,
it was to be presumed that the wild shores of the
Amoor would have afforded a still more ample and
extraordinary field for his researches. During his
stay at Selinginsk, he observed, among other curious
animals and birds, the blue crow, which was easily
taken, as its young were hitherto unfledged; and a
species of small white hare, which was found in great
numbers in the little islands in the Selinga. Besides
these there was the leaping hare, which, mingling at
night among the sheep, frightened them by its bounding
motions. The Mongols, who are fond of its
flesh when roasted, imagine that it sucks the ewes;
as the vulgar in England report of the hedgehog and
the cow.</p>

<p>Previous to his finally quitting the country, he
made another excursion to the frontiers of China,
principally, it would seem, for the purpose of studying
the botany of those districts, when the flowers
were clothed in all the beauty of summer. The road
to Kiakta traverses a large sandy plain, and afterward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
a succession of rocky mountains, entirely
destitute of wood. In this latter district our traveller
observed a species of locust, by whose flight
the natives could foretel with certainty whether the
weather would be fair or otherwise. They mounted
aloft on the wing previous to rainy weather, and the
noise of their motions resembled that of castanets.
After remaining some short time in the vicinity of
Kiakta, he once more returned to Selinginsk, and
began to make the necessary preparations for retracing
their footsteps to Krasnoiarsk, where they again
intended to pass the winter. Accordingly, on the 3d
of July, Pallas and a part of his companions departed
from Selinginsk, and proceeded towards the Baikal.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the eastern shore of the lake, they
saw a thick cold mist, which appeared to fill the
whole extent of its vast basin, and hung close upon
the surface of the water. This fog exactly resembled
those fogs which are sometimes collected in
the hollows of the mountains, or on the shores of
the sea. It was kept in continual motion, and tossed
hither and thither, like the waves of the ocean, by
the wind. This mist was accompanied by strong
westerly winds, which prevented our traveller from
proceeding on his way; and he amused himself
during his detention in studying the fishes of the
lake, together with the birds and animals which frequent
its shores.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July, he embarked, and set sail
with boisterous and contrary winds. The passage
of the lake was long, but, arriving at length at Zimovia,
Pallas proceeded with all possible expedition
to Krasnoiarsk, by way of Irkutsk. He arrived on
the 1st of August at the point of destination, where,
to his great satisfaction, he found that a magnificent
collection of the flowers which adorn the banks of
the Yeniseï had been made during the spring and
summer, by one of his pupils, whom he had left
behind for that purpose. From Krasnoiarsk, our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
traveller made another long excursion, visited several
Tartar hordes, various mines, mountains, and
tombs, and returned about the middle of September,
the approach of winter being already visible in those
high latitudes. By December, the cold had reached
an intensity which had never been felt even in Siberia.
The air was still, and at the same time condensed,
as it were; so that, although the sky was
exceedingly clear, the sun appeared as if beheld
through a cloud. In the morning of the 6th of December,
Pallas found the mercury of his thermometer
frozen, “a thing,” says he, “which had never
before happened during the whole eight years in
which I had made use of this instrument. I then
conveyed it from the gallery where it was kept
into an apartment moderately warmed with a
stove. Here the column of mercury, which had
been condensed in the tube, immediately sunk into
the bulb, while that in the bulb resumed its activity
in the course of half a minute. I repeated this experiment
several times with the same result, so that
sometimes there remained but a very few particles
in the tube, sometimes not above one. In order to
follow the progress of the experiment, I gently
warmed the bulb with my fingers, after it had been
exposed to the air, and watching the mounting of
the mercury, distinctly observed that the condensed
and frozen columns offered considerable resistance
before they gave way. At the same time I exposed
about a quarter of a pound of mercury to the air, in
a saucer. This mercury had been previously well
washed in vinegar, and cleansed from impurities.
The saucer was placed in a gallery on the north
side of my house. In an hour the edges of the surface
were frozen, and a few minutes afterward, the
whole superficies was condensed into a soft mass,
exactly resembling pewter. As the interior, however,
still continued fluid, a small portion of the surface
presented numerous wrinkles branching out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
from each other, but the greater part was sufficiently
smooth. The same thing took place with a
still larger quantity which I placed in the open air.
This mass of frozen mercury was as pliable as lead
but if bent suddenly, would break more easily than
pewter; and when flattened into sheets, appeared
somewhat knotty. I tried to beat it out with the
hammer, but being quite cold, the mercury fell from
it in drops. The same thing took place when you
touched this mass with the finger, the top of which
was instantly benumbed with cold by the simple contact.
I then placed it in a moderately warm room,
and it melted like wax placed over the fire. The
drops separated from the surface, which melted
gradually. The intensity of the cold diminished
towards the evening.”</p>

<p>In the month of January, 1773, Pallas began to
make preparations for returning to Petersburg, and
departing on the 22d, pushed on with the utmost rapidity
to Tomsk. During this journey, he discovered
the execrable principles upon which it was
attempted to people Siberia. The refuse of the
people, the lame, the sick, the infirm, and the old,
had been collected together, and sent thither to die.
Men had been torn, for this purpose, from their
wives and families. Women, for some reason or
another, had not been allowed to emigrate from the
west in sufficient numbers, and vice and misery
flourished in their absence. Man, deprived of the
society of women, necessarily degenerates into a
ferocious beast, contemning all laws, and every
regulation of morality. “It is not good that man
should be alone.” Whenever new colonies are established,
women should be numerous. It is they
who are the grand instruments of civilization.&mdash;The
cavern, the desert hut, when inhabited by a
woman, already contains the germs of humanity,
of hospitality, of improvement; but without her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
is a den, a haunt of ungovernable passions,&mdash;a refuge
from the storm, but not a home.</p>

<p>In crossing a bridge over the Dooroosh, in the
country of the Votiaks, our traveller was placed in
a more perilous condition than he had experienced
during any former period of his travels. His horses
had already reached the shore, when the bridge,
which must have been a very frail structure, gave
way under his carriage, and he must infallibly have
been precipitated into the stream, had not the spirited
horses dashed on at the moment, and dragged up the
carriage from amid the falling ruins.</p>

<p>The country between the Jaik and the Volga was
at that period a vast desert, which abounded with
wild horses. Pallas, however, was of opinion that
these animals had once been tame, but, during the
emigrations and nomadic movements of the Kalmucs
and Kirghees, had escaped into the wilderness,
where they had multiplied exceedingly. To fly from
the heat and the hornets, these horses wandered far
into the north during the summer months, and there,
besides a refuge from their persecutors, found better
pasturage, and an abundance of water. The surface
of this great Mesopotamia was sprinkled at intervals
with ruins of Tartar edifices, which swarmed in an
extraordinary manner with serpents.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June our traveller arrived at the
Moravian colony of Sarepta, which in eight years
had increased, by immigration, from five persons to
two thousand five hundred; and was at this period
in a highly flourishing state. He here entered into
some curious researches respecting the ancient
shores of the Caspian, whose waters, in his opinion,
once covered the greater portion of the Kalmuc
country, just as those of the Black Sea did all the
low lands upon its banks, before the deluge of Deucalion,
when they first burst the huge natural mound
which separated them from the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Pallas passed the autumn at Zarizyn, where he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
observed the Kalmucs moving westward in hordes
towards the country lying between the Volga and
the Don. From this place he made an excursion
through the stepps which lie up the stream of the
Volga; on his return from which he chiefly employed
himself in botanical researches, until the
spring of 1774. He then undertook another journey
along the banks of the Aktooba, through a country
infested with bands of vagabond Kirghees, and other
wandering nations, and returned to his head-quarters
on the 25th of May.</p>

<p>It was now six years since the expedition had set
out from Petersburg, and all its members began to
desire repose. Each person, therefore, hastened to
return by the shortest road to the capital. Pallas
was directed to repair to Moscow, and punctually
obeyed his orders, without making the slightest
deviation to the right-hand or to the left. He arrived
at this ancient city on the 3d of July, 1774.
“Here,” says he, “I found the orders of the court,
by which I was commanded to hasten without the
least delay to Petersburg; and, notwithstanding that
I felt exceedingly desirous of making a short stay
at Moscow, for the purpose of improving my knowledge,
by conversing with the learned M. Müller, one
of the most excellent men in Russia, as well as one
of the most celebrated of its historians, <i>it was necessary
to yield and obey</i>.” Such is the condition of
those who travel by command. He arrived at Petersburg
on the 30th of July, exhausted by fatigue,
and with a head sprinkled with premature gray
hairs; for he was then no more than thirty-three
years old.</p>

<p>The companions of Pallas had suffered still more
severely; scarcely one of them lived long enough
to draw up an account of his travels; and it was
therefore left to him to render this piece of justice
to their memory. For himself, the splendid objects
which he had beheld had made too profound an impression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
on his mind to allow of his being satisfied
with the accounts of them which he had hastily
traced in his journal. He therefore determined
upon the publication of several separate works,
which should contain the natural history of the
most celebrated quadrupeds of Siberia; and these
he actually laid before the public, together with descriptions
of a great number of birds, reptiles, and
fishes. In addition to all these, he even projected
a natural history of all the animals and plants in the
Russian empire; in which design, though it was
never completed, he made a very considerable progress.
The empress herself, worthless and profligate
as she was, was possessed by the ambition of
being regarded as the patron of the sciences, and in
order to facilitate the execution of our traveller’s
project, communicated to him the herbariums of
several other botanists, who had studied the flora
of the empire. To secure the completion of the
undertaking, Catherine moreover engaged to furnish
the expense of the engraving and printing of the
work; but the end was not answerable to this magnificent
beginning; projects of more vulgar ambition,
or vile and despicable amours, too fully occupied
the imperial mind to allow so unimportant a thing
as the science of botany to command a thought, and
Pallas was constrained to rely upon his own resources
for making known his botanical discoveries
to the world. The same fate attended his works on
the natural history of the animals and insects of the
empire.</p>

<p>M. Cuvier, whose capacity to appreciate the labours
of a scientific man can scarcely be called in question,
observes, that it is seldom that very laborious men
possess sufficient tranquillity of mind to conceive
those root-ideas which produce a revolution in the
sciences; but Pallas formed an exception to this
rule. He nearly succeeded in changing the whole
aspect of the science of zoology; and most certainly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
did operate a complete change in that of the
theory of the earth. An attentive consideration of
the two great chains of mountains of Siberia enabled
him to discover this general rule, which has
been everywhere found to hold good, that there
exist three primitive orders of mountains, the granitic
in the centre, the schistous next in succession,
and the calcareous on the outside. It may be said
that this great discovery, distinctly announced in a
memoir read before the academy in 1777, gave birth
to the modern science of geology: from this point
the Saussures, the Delues, and the Werners proceeded
to the discovery of the real structure of the
earth, which is so exceedingly at variance with the
fantastic ideas of preceding writers.</p>

<p>In addition to his scientific labours, Pallas was engaged
by Catherine in drawing up comparative vocabularies
of the languages spoken by all the various
nations in the Russian empire; but was restrained,
in the execution of this plan, to follow exactly in
the track pointed out by his mistress. He was
likewise chosen member of the committee employed,
in 1777, in compiling a new topography of
the empire; and had the honour of instructing
Alexander, the late despot of Russia, and his brother
Constantine, in natural history. But, notwithstanding
all these marks of distinction, and many others
of equal importance, our traveller experienced the
truth, that happiness is incompatible with dependence
of every kind. His travelling habits, too, rendered
a sedentary life irksome to him; but what
still further disgusted him with Petersburg, was the
crowd of fashionable but absurd people who thronged
his house, imagining, perhaps, they were doing him
an honour by consuming his time. To escape from
this species of persecution, he took advantage of
the invasion of the Crimea, to visit new countries;
and during the years 1793 and 1794, traversed the
southern provinces of the empire at his own expense.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
He even skirted the frontiers of Circassia,
but, with his usual prudence, avoided the dangers
which would have attended a journey into that
country. He then proceeded into the Crimea,
through which Potemkin was leading the empress
as a spectacle of contempt and scorn to all mankind;
and was so captivated by a passing glance at
its splendid scenery, that, on his return to Petersburg,
he solicited and obtained permission to retire
thither.</p>

<p>Solitude, however, which appeared so desirable at
a distance, Pallas soon found to be an intolerable
curse; the climate, also, fell infinitely short of his
expectations, was inconstant and humid, and liable
to be altered by every passing wind. It united, in
fact, the inconveniences of the north and of the south;
yet our traveller endured these evils for fifteen years;
but at length, feeling the approaches of old age, he
determined at once to escape from the climate of
the Crimea and from Russian despotism, and selling
his estates at an exceedingly low rate, returned to
his native city, after an absence of forty-two years.
His health, however, had been so completely undermined
by the diseases he had contracted during his
travels, and, more than all, by his long residence in
the Crimea, that he might be said merely to have
looked upon his native place, and on the face of
those friends or admirers which his knowledge and
fame had gathered around him, before death removed
him from the enjoyment of all these things. This
event took place on the 8th of September, 1811.
Pallas appears to have been an able, learned, and
upright man, deeply intent on promoting the interests
of science, but indifferent about those great
political rights without the enjoyment of which
even the sciences themselves are of no more dignity
or value than the tricks of a juggler.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CARSTEN_NIEBUHR">CARSTEN NIEBUHR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">Born 1733.&mdash;Died 1815.</p>

<p>This traveller was born on the 17th of March,
1733, in the province of Friesland, in the kingdom
of Hanover. It would be to mislead the reader to
represent him, as some of his biographers have
done, as the son of a peasant, in the sense in which
that term is applied in England. His father and his
ancestors, for several generations, had been small
landed proprietors; he himself received an education,
and inherited a property, which, however small,
served as an incentive to ambition; and though, like
many others, he found the entrance of the road to
fame rugged and hard to tread, it must not be dissembled
that his prudence and perseverance were
singularly aided by good fortune.</p>

<p>Having lost his mother before he was six weeks
old, the care of his infancy was intrusted to a step-mother;
and he was still a lad when his father likewise
died. The guardians upon whom the superintendence
of his youth at first devolved, entertaining,
apparently, but little respect for intellectual pursuits,
interrupted his studies; and his maternal uncle, who
succeeded them in this important trust, would seem
to have wanted the means, if he possessed the will,
to direct the course of a young man. Niebuhr was
therefore left very much to his own guidance, which,
to a man of vigorous intellect, I am far from regarding
as a misfortune. The beginnings of life, however,
like the beginnings of day, are generally
accompanied by mists which obscure the view, and
render it absolutely impossible to determine with
precision the character of the various paths which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
present themselves before us; and thus it was that
our traveller, who, knowing not that Providence
was about to conduct him to a brilliant destiny in
the East, at one time studied music, with the intention
of becoming an organist, and was afterward led,
through accidental circumstances, to apply himself
to geometry, for the purpose of practising as a land-surveyor.</p>

<p>With this design he repaired, in his twenty-third
year, to Bremen, where he discovered a person from
whom he might have derived the necessary instruction;
but finding that this individual’s domestic
economy was under the superintendence of two
youthful sisters, whose behaviour towards himself
Niebuhr seems to have regarded as forward and
indecorous, he immediately quitted this city and
proceeded to Hamburgh. It will easily be conceived
that the studies of a young man who voluntarily
cultivated his intellect as the only means by which
he could arrive at distinction, were pursued with
ardent enthusiasm. Niebuhr, in fact, considered
labour and toil as the only guides to genuine glory,
and was content to tolerate on the way the rude
fierceness of their manners.</p>

<p>When he had studied the mathematics, during two
years, under Büsch, he removed to Göttingen, where
he continued another year. At this period the
Danish ministry, at the suggestion of Michaelis, had
projected a scientific expedition into Arabia, which
was at first designed, at least by its originator,
merely to throw some light upon certain passages of
the Old Testament, but which afterward embraced
a much wider field. Michaelis, to whom the choice
of the individuals who were to form this mission
had been intrusted, betrayed the narrowness or
malignity of his mind, by neglecting the celebrated
Reiske, who was then well known to be struggling
with starvation, in order to thrust forward Von
Haven, a pupil of his own, who, but for this partial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
choice, would probably have lived and died in obscurity.
Niebuhr himself was recommended to
Michaelis by Kästner, whose pupil he had for some
time been. The proposal was abruptly made, and
as suddenly accepted. “Have you a mind,” said
Kästner, “to go into Arabia?”&mdash;“Why not?” replied
Niebuhr, “if anybody will pay my expenses.”&mdash;“The
King of Denmark,” said Kästner, “will pay
your expenses.” He then entered into the history
of the Danish ministry’s project, and Niebuhr, whose
genuine ambition was most ardent, and who, though
in manners modest and unassuming, could not but
entertain a favourable opinion of his own capacity,
at once engaged to form a member of the mission.
It was agreed, on the part of his Danish majesty,
that he should be allowed a year and a half for
preparation, with a salary sufficient for his maintenance.</p>

<p>Niebuhr had now a definite object. The East,
with all its barbaric pomp and historical glory, which
in preceding and succeeding days have kindled enthusiasm
in so many bosoms, appeared to court his
examination; and, like a lover who appreciates at
their highest value the accomplishments of his mistress,
and is bent on rendering himself worthy of
her, he thenceforward studied, with vehement earnestness,
all those branches of knowledge which he
regarded as necessary to a traveller in the East;
and Latin, Arabic, the mathematics, drawing, practical
mechanics, together with the history of the
countries he was about to visit, amply occupied his
hours. An additional half-year being granted him,
it was not until the Michaelmas of 1760 that he
quitted Göttingen for Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Here he was received in the most flattering manner
by Count Bernstorf, the Danish minister, by
whom he was appointed lieutenant of engineers.
The rank of captain he modestly refused. Niebuhr
was never possessed by an immoderate desire for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
wealth, and a trait of unpresuming disinterestedness
which escaped him during his preparatory
studies is at once illustrative of this fact, and of
another equally important,&mdash;that wealth no less than
fame is frequently best won by carefully abstaining
from grasping at it too eagerly. The salary granted
him by the King of Denmark was probably small,
but our traveller, with that repugnance to solicit
which is characteristic of superior minds, not only
contrived to reduce his wants within the limits of
his means, but by rigid economy enabled himself,
moreover, to purchase at his own expense whatever
instruments he needed. The knowledge of this fact
coming to the ears of the minister, he not only
reimbursed the young traveller the sum he had expended,
but, as a mark of the high satisfaction he
derived from so striking an evidence of honest independence,
committed to his charge the travelling-chest
of the mission.</p>

<p>Niebuhr’s companions were four in number: Von
Haven, the linguist, a person of mean capacity;
Forskaal, the naturalist, distinguished for his numerous
and profound acquirements; Cramer, a physician,
devoid even of professional knowledge; and
Baurenfeind, an artist, not destitute of talent, but
ignorant, full of prejudices, and addicted to the vulgar
habit of drinking. Von Haven, to whom a long
sea-voyage was disagreeable, obtained permission
to proceed to Marseilles by land; and the ship in
which the other members of the expedition embarked
was directed to take him on board at that
port. They left the Sound on the 7th of January,
1761, but were three times driven back by contrary
winds; so that it was not until the 10th of March
that they were enabled fairly to put to sea, and continue
their voyage.</p>

<p>Niebuhr describes, among the singular things observed
during this voyage, a white rainbow, which
only differed from the common rainbow in being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
destitute of colours. This, I believe, is a phenomenon
not often witnessed; but on the 21st of May,
1830, which succeeded a day and night of tremendous
thunder, lightning, and rain, I remember to
have myself seen a similar rainbow in Normandy.
It was much thicker, but greatly inferior in span,
and less sharply defined at the edges than the ordinary
bow; and, as the morning mist upon which it
was painted grew thinner, the arch decreased in
span, until it at length vanished entirely.</p>

<p>Our traveller amused himself while on board in
observing the manners of the crew, which he considered
manly though unpolished. He likewise exercised
himself daily in nautical and astronomical
observations; and by his affability and the extent
of his knowledge, acquired and preserved the respect
of both officers and men. They discovered
Cape St. Vincent on the 21st of April, and a few
days afterward entered the Mediterranean, where
their course was considerably retarded by calms and
contrary winds. Meanwhile the weather was beautiful,
and their eyes were refreshed with the most
lovely prospects, now on the African shores, and
now on those of Europe. On the 14th of May they
cast anchor in the port of Marseilles, which was at
that time crowded by Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Spanish,
and French ships, the greater number of which
were prevented from putting to sea by fear of the
English fleets, which scoured the Mediterranean,
diffusing consternation and terror on all sides.</p>

<p>From the agreeable society of Marseilles, rendered
doubly charming in their estimation by their previous
privation, they were soon compelled to snatch themselves
away. On the 6th of June Niebuhr observed
at sea the transit of Venus, and on the 14th reached
Malta. This little island enjoys, like Ireland, the
privilege of being free from serpents, which it is
supposed to owe to the interference of St. Paul;
though Niebuhr imagines that the dry and rocky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
nature of the soil is sufficient, without a miracle, to
account for the circumstance. The knights observing,
perhaps, a peculiar absence of bigotry in our
traveller, imagined that this indicated a leaning towards
Catholicism, and appear to have been desirous
of tempting him by magnificent promises to desert
the creed of his forefathers. Though his stay in
Malta was very short, Niebuhr was careful to observe
whatever curiosities the island afforded: the
great church of St. John, enriched, it is said, by
sharing the plunder of the knights, with innumerable
ornaments, and a prodigious candelabrum of gold;
the hospital, where the sick, whatever might be
their medical treatment, were served with vessels
of silver; the immense corn-magazines, hewn out
in the rock; the salt-mines; and the catacombs.
For some reason, however, which is not stated, he
did not see the Phenician inscription, which was
still preserved in the island.</p>

<p>In sailing from Malta to Smyrna he was attacked
with dysentery, and began to fear that his travels
were to terminate there; but the disorder was less
serious than he imagined, and having reached Tenedos,
he embarked in a Turkish boat, and proceeded
up the Dardanelles to Constantinople. Here, though
slowly, he recovered his health, and having remained
quiet two months, and provided oriental dresses, not
choosing to expose himself in the paltry costume of
Europe to the laughter of the populace, he set sail
with his companions for Egypt.</p>

<p>On the way they landed at Rhodes, where, for the
first time they visited a Turkish eating-house. The
dinner, though dear, was good, but was served up in
common earthen platters, in the open street. They
next visited a Jew, who kept wine for the accommodation
of Europeans; and had in his house two
young women, whom he called his daughters, who
were probably designed for the same purpose. Their
reception here cost them still dearer than their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Turkish dinner; and as Jews, wine, and the drinkers
of wine are held in contempt by all sincere and respectable
Mohammedans, this must be considered a
highly injudicious step in Niebuhr. The ship in
which they sailed had on board a number of female
slaves, the principal of whom were lodged in a large
chamber directly over their cabin, from which we
may infer that the Turks do not, like the Burmese,
consider it a disgrace to have women walking over
their heads. As there were tolerably wide cracks
in the ceiling, our travellers frequently enjoyed the
pleasure of viewing these ladies, who, though a little
terrified at first, soon became accustomed to their
faces, and notwithstanding that neither party at all
understood the language of the other, many little
presents of fruit and other trifles were given and
returned. The mode in which this affair was conducted
was ingenious. As soon as the Mohammedans
collected together for prayer, the girls gently
tapped at their windows, and Niebuhr and Forskaal,
looking out of the cabin, beheld the handkerchiefs
of the fair held out for fruit. When filled, they were
drawn up, and the presents they chose to make in
return were then lowered down in the same way.
During the voyage, six or eight persons having died
suddenly, it was suspected that they had the plague
on board; but Niebuhr imagined that other causes
might have hastened the end of those who died; at
all events, none of the members of the expedition
were infected, though their physician had often
visited the sick.</p>

<p>The land of Egypt at length appeared on the 26th
of September, and on the same day, late in the evening,
they cast anchor in the port of Alexandria.
Norden, a scientific, but an uninteresting traveller,
having recently constructed a plan of the city, Niebuhr
judged that he might spare himself the pains
of repeating the process, more especially as the
Arabs, hovering in troops in the vicinity, rendered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
him apprehensive that he might be robbed. However,
as the eminence on which Pompey’s pillar
stands overlooks a large portion of the city, he
amused himself with taking several angles from
thence, intending to follow this up by taking others
from some other positions. While he was thus engaged,
one of the Turkish merchants, who happened
to be present, observing his telescope pointed towards
the city, had the curiosity to look through it,
and was not a little alarmed at perceiving a tower
upside down. “This,” says he, “gave occasion to
a rumour, that I was come to Alexandria to turn the
whole city topsyturvy. The report reached the
governor’s house. My janizary refused to accompany
me when I took out my instrument; and as I
then supposed that a European could not venture to
appear in an eastern city without a janizary, I relinquished
the idea of making any further geometrical
measurements there.”&mdash;“On another occasion,” he
continues, “when I was making an astronomical
observation on the southern point of the Delta, a
very civil and sensible peasant, from the village of
Daraúe, happened to be present. As I wished to
show him something he had never seen before, I
pointed the telescope of the quadrant towards his
village, on which he was extremely terrified at seeing
all the houses upside down. He asked my servant
what could be the cause of this. The man
replied, that the government, being extremely dissatisfied
with the inhabitants of that village, had sent
me to overthrow it entirely. The poor peasant
was greatly afflicted, and entreated me to wait long
enough for him to take his wife, his children, and
his cow to some place of safety. My servant
assured him he had two hours good. He immediately
ran home, and as soon as the sun had
passed the meridian, I took my quadrant on board
again.”</p>

<p>Niebuhr found a number of Mohammedans at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Alexandria who understood French, Swedish, and
Danish as completely as if they had been born in
the countries where those languages are spoken.
As most European travellers proceed up the Nile
from this city to Cairo, the members of the expedition
were desirous of performing the journey by
land, but were restrained by fear of the Arabs; and
M. Forskaal, who afterward ventured upon this
hardy enterprise, was actually stripped to the skin,
and with great difficulty obtained back his breeches.
Niebuhr now hired a small ship, and embarked on
the 31st of October, but was detained in the Gulf
of Aboukir by contrary winds. Impatient of delay,
his companions proceeded thence to Rosetta by
land, with a company of Turks; but our traveller
continued his voyage, and reached the city very
shortly after them. Though the inhabitants of Rosetta
enjoyed the reputation of being peculiarly
polite towards strangers, Niebuhr was too impatient
to behold the capital of modern Egypt to linger long
in any provincial city; he therefore hastened to ascend
the Nile, and enjoyed the romantic prospect
of fertility, villages peeping through groves of date-trees,
and here and there vast wrecks of ancient
cities, which all travellers in that extraordinary
country have admired. They arrived at Cairo on
the 10th of November.</p>

<p>The Nile, like the Ganges, has long been renowned
for the daring race of pirates who infest it.
Bruce, and many other travellers, have celebrated
their ingenuity; but the following anecdote, related
by Niebuhr, exhibits their exquisite skill in a still
more favourable point of view: A pasha, recently
arrived in Egypt, happening to be encamped on the
banks of the river, his servants, aware of the dexterity
of their countrymen, kept so strict a watch
during the night, that they detected one of the
pirates, and brought him before the pasha, who
threatened to put him to death on the spot. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
prisoner, however, entreated permission to show
the pasha one of the extraordinary tricks of his art,
in the hope of thereby inducing him to spare his
life. The permission was granted. The man then
took up the pasha’s garments, and whatever else he
found in the tent, and having tied them up into a
packet, as the Egyptians do when they are about to
swim across a river, made several turns before the
company to amuse them. He then insensibly approached
the Nile, and darting into the water like
lightning, had already reached the opposite shore,
with the pasha’s garments upon his head, before
the Turks could get ready their muskets to fire
at him.</p>

<p>Niebuhr was exceedingly desirous, soon after his
arrival at Cairo, of descending the eastern branch
of the Nile to Damietta; but the sky during the
whole winter and spring was so overcast with
clouds, and the rain fell so frequently, that it was
impossible to take astronomical observations. On
the 1st of May, however, the weather having cleared
up, he left Cairo. The wind blowing from the north,
their progress was slow, and he had therefore
considerable leisure for observation. The Coptic
churches amused him much. In one of these he
saw pictures representing Christ, the Virgin, and
several saints, on horseback; intended, perhaps, to
insinuate to their Mohammedan masters, that the
founder of their religion and his followers had not
been compelled, as Christians then were in Egypt,
to ride upon asses. These churches, moreover,
were strewed with so many crutches, that a stranger
might conclude, upon observing them, that the whole
Coptic community had lost the use of their limbs;
however, upon inquiry, our traveller discovered that
it was the custom among them to stand in church,
which many persons found so wearisome that they
resolved to aid their piety with crutches. The
floors were covered with mats, which, not being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
changed very frequently, swarmed with fleas, numbers
of which did our traveller the honour to prefer
him before any of their ancient patrons. In approaching
Damietta he saw about twenty large
boats loaded with bees: each of these boats carried
two hundred hives; the number, therefore, of the
hives here assembled in one spot, was four thousand;
and when the inhabitants of this floating city issued
forth to visit the flowers of the neighbourhood, they
must have appeared like a locust cloud.</p>

<p>His stay at Damietta, which is about four miles
above the mouth of the Nile, was short. Europeans
are nowhere in the East so much detested, on account,
chiefly, of the profligate character of the
French formerly settled there, who, having debauched
several Mohammedan women, were nearly
all massacred by the infuriated populace. Niebuhr’s
fancy that they still remember the crusades, and
hate the Franks for the evils those insane expeditions
inflicted on their ancestors, is just as rational
as if the English people were to be supposed to
nourish resentment against all the northern nations,
because their barbarous ancestors made piratical
descents upon our coasts.</p>

<p>While at Cairo he could not, of course, resist the
desire of visiting the Pyramids. He therefore hired
two Bedouin guides, and proceeded with his friend
Forskaal towards the desert, where they were encountered
by a young sheïkh, who, by dint of bravado
and insolence, succeeded in extorting from
them a small sum of money; but had they, when
he first offered his services, bestowed upon him half
a crown, he would not only have given them no
further molestation, but would have constituted himself
their protector against all other importunates.
Niebuhr afterward returned under more favourable
auspices, and completed the measurement of the two
great pyramids, the loftier of which he found to be
443 feet, and the second to be 403 feet high. I shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
hereafter, perhaps, have occasion to remark upon
the strange discrepancies which are found between
the measurements of various travellers, which are,
in fact, so great, that we must suspect some of them,
at least, of having wanted the knowledge required
by such an undertaking. From considering the
petrifactions and the nature of the rocks in this
neighbourhood, Niebuhr was led to infer the prodigious
antiquity of Egypt: “Supposing the whole
of the rocks in the northern portions of the country
to be composed of petrifactions of a certain kind
of shell, how many years,” says he, “must have
elapsed before a sufficient number of little snails to
raise mountains to their present height could have
been born and died! How many other years before
Egypt could have been drained and become solid,
supposing that, in those remote ages, the waters retired
from the shore as slowly as they have during
the last ten centuries! How many years still, before
the country was sufficiently peopled to think of
erecting the first pyramid! How many more years,
before that vast multitude of pyramids which are
still found in the country could have been constructed!
Considering that at the present day we
are ignorant of when, and by whom, even the most
modern of them was built.”</p>

<p>On the 26th of August, 1762, Niebuhr and his
companions set out with the caravan going from
Cairo to Suez: the rest of the party, in spite of the
Mohammedans, mounted on horseback, and Niebuhr
himself on a dromedary. By this means he avoided
several evils to which the others were liable. Seated
on his mattress he could turn his face now on one
side, now on another, to avoid the heat of the sun; and,
after having travelled all day, was no more fatigued
in the evening than if he had been all the while reposing
in a chair; while the horsemen, compelled
to remain perpetually in the same posture, were well-nigh
exhausted. On the 30th they encamped near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
a well of good water, mentioned by Belin, Pietro
Della Valle, and Pococke, close to which the Turks
formerly erected a castle, which was now in ruins,
and in three hours more arrived at the wells of Suez,
which were surrounded by a strong wall, to keep
out the Arabs, and entered by a door fastened with
enormous clumps of iron. The water here was
drawn up with buckets or sacks of leather.</p>

<p>Suez, from its fortunate position on the Red Sea,
carried on a considerable trade. Numbers of ships
were built there annually, the materials of which
were transported thither on the backs of camels
from Cairo. The environs consist of naked rocks,
or beds of loose sand, in which nothing but brambles
and a few dry stunted plants, among others the rose
of Jericho, are found to grow. This rose is employed
by the women of the East in various superstitious
practices, and is therefore to be found for
sale in all cities. When pregnant, they gather one
of the buds, and putting its stem in water, foretel
whether their pains will be severe or slight from the
greater or smaller development of the flower.</p>

<p>Niebuhr’s first inquiry on arriving at Suez was
concerning the “Mountain of Inscriptions,” about
which so much had been said in Europe. The individuals
to whom his first questions were put had
never even heard of it; others, who were exactly in
the same predicament, but desired to possess themselves
of a little of their European gold, professed a
most accurate knowledge of the spot, but upon inquiry
were detected. At length, however, an Arab
was discovered, from whose replies it was clear, that
whether he had seen the real <i>Gebel el Mokatteb</i> or
not, some mountain or another he had beheld, upon
which inscriptions in an unknown language were
to be found. Under this man’s guidance, therefore,
they placed themselves,&mdash;that is, Niebuhr and Von
Haven, for the rest were, from various causes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
detained at Suez; and leaving the Red Sea on their
right-hand, they struck off into the desert.</p>

<p>As I have given a description of this part of Arabia
in the life of Dr. Shaw, it will not be necessary here
to repeat what I then said. Niebuhr found that the
Arabs, whose profession it is to serve as guides,
were distinguished, like all other persons of that
class, for their extravagant cupidity. So long as
they could live at the expense of strangers their own
provisions and means were assiduously spared; but
on other occasions they exhibited various symptoms
that the old national virtue of hospitality was not
wholly banished from their minds. The women in
this part of Arabia are not in the habit of concealing
their faces from strangers, as is the fashion in Egypt.
Niebuhr, in his solitary rambles through the country,
discovered the wife and sister of a sheïkh grinding
corn beside their tent; who, instead of flying and
concealing themselves at his approach, as he seems
to have expected, came forward, according to the
good old custom of the East, with a present in their
hands.</p>

<p>On arriving at what his guides called the “Mountain
of Inscriptions,” a lofty rugged eminence, which
it cost them much time and toil to climb, he found&mdash;not
what he had expected&mdash;but a vast Egyptian cemetery,
in which were a great number of sepulchral
monuments, covered with hieroglyphics. These inscriptions
he was not permitted to copy at the time,
because the sheïkh of the mountain apprehended
he might thereby gain possession of the immense
treasures concealed beneath; but one of his guides,
who probably had little faith in that point of the
sheïkh’s creed, afterward, on his return from Mount
Sinai, enabled him to copy whatever he pleased.
On his arrival at the convent of St. Catherine the
monks politely refused to admit him, alleging, as
their excuse, that he had not brought along with him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
a letter from their bishop. The patriarch’s letter,
which he presented to them, they returned unopened.
He was, in fact, destined to meet with nothing but
disappointment in these celebrated regions; for his
Arabs, having conducted him up to a certain height
on Mount Sinai, refused to proceed any farther, and
he was not possessed of sufficient resolution to
ascend the remainder alone.</p>

<p>Niebuhr now hastened back to Suez, and on his
return forded the Red Sea on his dromedary, a thing
which no European had done before, though the
guides, who were on foot, did not find the water
above knee deep. Being desirous of surveying the
extremity of the Arabian Gulf, he procured a guide
soon after his return from Mount Sinai, with whom
he set out upon this expedition. They travelled,
however, in constant fear; and the sight of a
stranger in the distance increased the terrors of the
guide to so extraordinary a pitch, that I suspect he
had blood upon his hands, and dreaded the hour of
retribution.</p>

<p>The constant arrival of pilgrims from Egypt had
now rendered Suez, in proportion to its extent, more
populous than Cairo. These holy men, being on
their way to the city of their prophet, regarded
Christians with an evil eye, just as a bigoted Franciscan
travelling to Jerusalem would regard a
heretic or an unbeliever; and on this account
Niebuhr greatly dreaded the voyage he was about
to perform in their company from Suez to Jidda.
To avoid, as far as possible, all causes of dispute
with their fellow-passengers, they embarked several
days before the rest, paid their passage, stowed
away their luggage, and then amused themselves
with observing the strange characters by which they
were surrounded, not the least extraordinary of
which was a rich black eunuch, who, in imitation
of the great Turkish lords, travelled with his
harem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>All the passengers having at length repaired on
board, they set sail on the 9th of October, and sailing
along coral reefs, which in bad weather are highly
dangerous, they arrived next day at Tor. Near
this town is a small village inhabited by Christians,
to which Forskaal went alone, for the purpose of
visiting what is supposed to be the site of ancient
Elim. While he was absent it was rumoured on
board that the Arabs had formed the intention
of pursuing and arresting the Frank, who had landed
with the design of sketching their mountains; upon
which a number of janizaries from Cairo, who happened
to be on board, immediately set out for the
village, and having met with M. Forskaal, conducted
him back in safety to the vessel. “Are there many
Christians,” inquires Niebuhr, “who, under similar
circumstances, would do as much for a Jew?”</p>

<p>On the evening of the 16th of October they discovered,
about sunset, the Emerald Mountains on
the coast of Egypt, called <i>Gebel Zumrud</i> by the
Arabs. Next day there happened an eclipse of the
sun. In Mohammedan countries persons who are
able to calculate an eclipse are regarded as consummate
physicians. Forskaal had informed the reis,
or captain, that an eclipse was about to take place;
and to amuse him and keep him from interrupting
his astronomical observations, Niebuhr had smoked
several glasses, through which he, as well as the
principal merchants, might contemplate the phenomenon.
They were all greatly amused, and from
that moment Forskaal enjoyed the reputation of
being a second Avicenna. From a spirit of humane
complaisance, which induces us to allow every one
an opportunity of exhibiting his peculiar talents,
men are exceedingly apt to fall ill when they come
in contact with a physician. Our traveller’s Mohammedan
companions were particularly polite in this
way; for no sooner had they persuaded themselves
that there was a physician on board than they all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
discovered that they were attacked by diseases
which had previously lain dormant, and confidingly
demanded medicines and advice. Forskaal prescribed
for all. To the majority he recommended
more or less sleep, and a careful attention to their
diet. A pilgrim at length presented himself who
complained that he was unable to see during the
night. The physician advised him to light a candle.
This was excellent. The Arabs, who are naturally
lively, burst into a loud laugh, and all their diseases
were forgotten in a moment.</p>

<p>Between Ras Mohammed and Hassâni the ship
was twice in danger of being set on fire by the negligence
of the women; but at length they reached
this small island in safety, and the Mohammedans,
believing the principal danger to be now over, exhibited
various tokens of joy, firing muskets and
pistols, illuminating the ship with lamps and lanterns,
and uttering the triumphant cry of <i>Be, be, be!</i> so
commonly used by the orientals. The sailors and
the pilot petitioned for a present, the former coming
round to each passenger with a little boat in their
hands, which, when the collection was over, was
thrown into the sea. During this passage Niebuhr,
who, up to his arrival at Suez, had scarcely seen the
face of a Mohammedan woman, had an opportunity
of viewing three or four of them naked in a bath;
and his indiscreet curiosity very fortunately entailed
upon him no evil consequences.</p>

<p>On the 29th of October they arrived at Jidda,
where the usual attempts were made to defraud the
custom-house. In this praiseworthy design some
succeeded to the extent of their desires; but others,
less adroit, or more unfortunate, were detected and
compelled to pay the duties, no such atrocity as the
confiscation of the whole property being ever practised.
A duty of two or two and a half <i>per cent.</i>
being levied upon all specie, people were most
anxious to conceal their wealth: but by endeavouring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
to effect this, one of Niebuhr’s companions suffered
severely; for in stepping from the ship into
the boat, his purse, which he had tied round his body,
opened accidentally, and about a hundred crowns
fell into the sea. The common cash of the expedition
was conveyed on shore in the bottoms of their
boxes of drugs, which were not searched, it being in
Arabia a general opinion that physicians, having no
need of money, seldom carry any about with them.</p>

<p>Niebuhr had observed in Egypt that the populace
looked with inexpressible contempt upon Christians,
and thence inferred that in proportion as they
approached the Holy City they should find this
inhospitable bigotry on the increase; but his apprehensions
were unfounded, for the people of Jidda,
long accustomed to the sight of Europeans, and
constantly experiencing the humanizing influence
of commerce, were peculiarly refined, allowing
strangers to do almost what they pleased. It was
merely forbidden them to approach the Mecca gate;
which, like the city to which it leads, is reputed
holy. Our traveller, during his residence at Cairo,
had formed an acquaintance with a poor sheïkh,
who, for a Mohammedan, might be said to be as
highly favoured by science as he was neglected by
fortune; and this man, in gratitude for the knowledge
he had derived from him, besides furnishing him
with letters of recommendation to the Kihaya and
Pasha of Jidda, had privately written to those important
personages, who had honoured him for his
knowledge, earnestly requesting them to show every
possible mark of kindness and attention to his
European friends. These were the letters from
which they had least expectations, and presented
last; nevertheless, when the recommendations of
all their other friends had failed even to procure
them a lodging, those of the poor sheïkh introduced
them to powerful protectors. Niebuhr was here
witness of the curious mode of catching wild ducks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
noticed by Pococke in Upper Egypt, and by another
English traveller in China. When a number of these
birds were observed in the water, the sportsman undressed,
covered his head with seaweed, and then
crept quietly into the water. By this means the
ducks were deceived, so that they allowed the man
to come near and catch them by the legs.</p>

<p>They remained at Jidda until the 14th of December,
when they embarked in one of the country vessels for
Loheia. Niebuhr was not possessed of the art of
painting what he saw with the fine colours of language.
His narrative is frequently dry even to insipidity.
He was observant, he was calm, he was
judicious, but he was destitute of eloquence, and this
deficiency is nowhere in his works more strongly
felt than in his account of his various voyages
through the Red Sea. On the 22d they landed on
the coast of Yemen, near Fej el Jelbe, inhabited by
Bedouins, who are suspected of being pagans. A
few tents were discovered on the shore, and as soon
as the travellers had landed, which they did unarmed
lest they should be taken for enemies, several of the
wild natives came down to meet them. Their appearance
and dress were extraordinary. Their
dark hair descended in profusion to their shoulders;
and instead of a turban, several of them had merely
a cord tied round the head, intended, I imagine, to
keep their tresses in order. Others, more careful
and industrious, had woven themselves a kind
of bonnet with green palm-leaves. A miserable
waist-cloth constituted the whole of their dress.
From the eagerness of the sailors to get their lances
out of their hands they immediately discovered that
they were suspected; upon which they cast the
weapons on the ground, assuring the strangers that
they had nothing to fear. Notwithstanding that
they had landed in search of provisions the Bedouins
conducted them to their tents, where two women
came out to meet them. Their salutation was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
curious. The women, who were unveiled, kissed
the arm of the sheïkh, who, in return, pressed their
heads with his lips. The ladies then advanced
towards the strangers. Their complexion was
sallow brown, they had blackened their eyelids with
surme, and died their nails with henne; and, like
the lower ranks of women in Egypt, exhibited marks
of tattooing on the chin, cheeks, and forehead.
Cosmetics being rare in those countries, they requested our
travellers to favour them with a small
quantity of kohol and al henne; but they had injudiciously
neglected to provide themselves with any
thing of the kind, and consequently saw themselves
in the disagreeable predicament of being compelled
to refuse.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Loheia they were received with
remarkable politeness by the emir and the chief merchants
of the city. They had taken the small vessel
in which they performed the voyage for a longer
passage as far as Hodeida; and the captain, understanding
that they had some intention of remaining
at Loheia, secretly applied to the emir with a request
that he would compel them to complete their engagement,
either by proceeding all the way to Hodeida,
or by paying the whole sum agreed upon.
With a generosity not often displayed towards utter
strangers by men in office, the emir replied, that
should the travellers refuse payment of the sum in
question, he himself would satisfy his demands; and
the principal merchant to whom the suspicious navigator
also applied entered into the same engagement.
Of course they were not allowed to suffer
by their grateful and astonished guests.</p>

<p>The above merchant, in his eastern style of hospitality,
gave them a house to live in during their
stay. In return the travellers amused him and the
emir with the effects of their microscopes, telescopes,
&amp;c. These things filled them with wonder;
crowds of people, curious but well-behaved, thronged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
their court from morning till night, examining with
attention whatever they saw, and expressing their
astonishment at every thing. This was too much
for Danish politeness. They hired a porter, and
stationing him at their door, gave strict orders that
none but professional men should be admitted. But
the curiosity of the Arabs was not to be subdued so
easily; for, when all other excuses failed, they
feigned illness, and gained admittance under pretence
of coming to consult the physician. Sometimes
Dr. Cramer, who appears to have been an uncouth
creature, was requested to favour sick persons
with a visit at their own houses, and one day received
a pressing entreaty to repair without delay
to the <i>emir el bahr</i>, or captain of the port, who had
need of consulting him. Cramer, not attending to
this summons immediately, was shortly afterward
informed that the <i>emir el bahr’s</i> saddle-horse was at
the door waiting for him. This piece of attention
was too flattering to be resisted; he therefore descended
immediately, and was about to put his foot
into the stirrup, when he was interrupted with the
information that the horse was unwell, and had been
brought there as a patient! Physicians in Arabia
prescribe for horses as well as men; this, therefore,
was not meant as an insult; but Cramer, who felt all
his Danish blood curdle in his veins at the bare idea
of prescribing for a Mohammedan horse, and was,
moreover, mortified at not being allowed to mount
his patient, indignantly refused to exercise the functions
of a horse-doctor. Luckily, however, their
European servant, who had served in a dragoon
regiment, understood something of the veterinary
art, and undertook the cure of the emir’s horse;
which succeeding happily, he also was regarded as
an eminent physician, and was allowed to elevate his
ambition to the treatment of men.</p>

<p>As our travellers continued, as far as possible, to
live after the European fashion, their manners were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
necessarily as much an object of curiosity to the
Arabs as those of the Arabs were to them. One
day two young men came to see them eat. Of these,
the one was a young nobleman from Sana, whose
gentle manners announced a superior education; the
other a young chief from the mountains, whose
country was seldom visited by strangers. This the
<i>naïveté</i> and simplicity of his manners soon rendered
manifest. Upon being invited to eat, he replied,
“God preserve me from eating with infidels, who
have no belief in God!” Niebuhr then demanded
the name of his country; “What,” said he, “can
my country concern thee? Hast thou formed the
design of going thither to subdue it?” He afterward
made several remarks upon their manners, the simplicity
of which excited their laughter; at which
the Arab felt ashamed, and ran away in confusion.
His companion fetched him back, however, and he
returned, wondering at the amazing quantity of food
which they devoured. Fowl after fowl disappeared
before these mighty eaters; the poor Arab, who
began to entertain awful ideas of the capacity of a
German stomach, and apprehending that they might
bring about a famine in the land, for a while looked
on in silent amazement; but when they had already
eaten as much as would, perhaps, have satisfied a
whole tribe of Bedouins, he started up, upon seeing
Von Haven preparing to carve yet another fowl, and
seizing him by the arm, exclaimed, “How much,
then, dost thou intend to eat?” This sally produced
still louder peals of laughter than ever, and the poor
Arab, who probably apprehended that they might
finish by eating him, rushed out of the house and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Having sufficiently observed whatever was interesting
or new at Loheia, they departed thence on
the 20th of February, 1763, their servants and baggage
mounted on camels, and themselves on asses.
Not that Europeans were here, as at Cairo, prohibited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
from riding on horseback, but that horses
were dear and not easily to be hired, while the asses,
though comparatively cheap, were large fine animals,
of easy gait. Arabia, it is well known, is surrounded
by a belt of burning sand, which has in all ages
aided in protecting it from invasion. This our travellers
had now to traverse, but they suffered no
particular inconvenience from the heat, and in four
days arrived at <i>Beit el Fakih</i>, the greatest coffee emporium
in the world.</p>

<p>Niebuhr, being now in a country where travelling
was attended with no risk, and desiring, apparently,
to escape from the society of his companions, hired
an ass, and set out alone on an excursion to several
neighbouring towns. This was succeeded by several
other excursions, and at length he proceeded to the
Coffee Mountains, a district which offers, perhaps,
as many curious particulars to the observation of a
traveller as any spot in Asia. These mountains
could be ascended only on foot. The road, though
rugged and broken, lay through coffee plantations and
gardens, and to Niebuhr, who had just quitted the
burning plains of the Tehama, afforded the most
exquisite gratification. The prospects, moreover,
which here meet the eye on all sides are rich and
beautiful. They are precisely what the hills of Judea
must have been before Sion had been profaned
by the heathen, when every man, confident in the
protection of the Lord, sat down tranquilly under
his vine or under his fig-tree. The small chain of
hills, called the Côte d’Or, which traverses nearly
the whole of Burgundy from north to south, and is
covered with vineyards to the summit, may probably
represent to a European eye the ridge of the Coffee
Mountains, except that the latter have necessarily
a more woody appearance, and are beautified by
numerous mountain streams, which frequently leap
in long cascades from the rocks. The coffee-tree,
which was at this time in full flower in many places,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
diffuses around an agreeable odour, and somewhat
resembles the Spanish jasmin. The Arabs plant
these trees so close that the rays of the sun can
scarcely find their way between them, which prevents
the necessity of frequent watering; but they
have reservoirs on the heights from which they can,
when necessary, turn numerous streamlets into the
plantations.</p>

<p>From the Coffee Mountains they returned to Beit
el Fakih, whence they shortly afterward departed
on another short excursion. The natives, who
carefully abstained from exposing themselves to the
sun during the heat of the day, expressed their
well-grounded astonishment that Europeans should
be imprudent enough to hazard so dangerous a step;
and our travellers were, in reality, at this very time
laying the foundation of those fatal diseases which
shortly afterward swept them away, Niebuhr only
excepted; for I am persuaded that they might have
returned, even in spite of their execrable diet and
destructive habits of drinking, to brave the climate
of Yemen, had they timed their journeys more judiciously.</p>

<p>By this time their appearance was tolerably oriental;
the sun had bronzed their countenances, their
beards had acquired a respectable length, their dress
was exactly that of the country, and they had,
moreover, adopted Arabic names. Even their guides
no longer took them for Europeans, but supposed
them to be members of the eastern church, who by
forbidden studies had succeeded in discovering the
art of making gold, and were searching among the
lonely recesses of their mountains for some rare
plant whose juices were requisite in their alchymical
processes. Niebuhr’s assiduous observation of the
stars considerably aided in strengthening this delusion,
which upon the whole, perhaps, was rather
beneficial to them than otherwise.</p>

<p>In the hilly districts of Yemen our traveller observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
among the Arabs a peculiar mode of passing
the night. Instead of making use of a bed, each
individual crept entirely naked into a sack, where,
without closing the mouth of it, the breath and transpiration
kept him sufficiently warm. Niebuhr himself
never tried the sack, but very soon acquired the
habit, which is universal among the Arabs of Yemen,
of sleeping with the face covered, to guard against the
malignant effects of the dews and poisonous winds.
Here M. Forskaal discovered the small tree that
produces the balm of Mecca, which happening to be
in flower at the time enabled him to write a complete
description of it, which he did seated under its
branches. The inhabitants, who knew nothing of
its value, merely made use of it as firewood, on
account of its agreeable odour.</p>

<p>Upon descending from these mountainous countries,
where the climate is as cool and salubrious as
in most parts of Europe, Niebuhr found the heat of
the Tehama almost insupportable, and entering a
little coffee-house, overwhelmed with fatigue, threw
himself on his mat in a current of air, and fell asleep.
This heedless action nearly cost him his life. He
awoke in a violent fever, which hung about him for
a considerable time, and reduced his frame to such
an extreme state of weakness that the slightest
exertion became painful. Von Haven, too, whose
supreme delight consisted in brandy, wine, and good
eating, and who seldom quitted his sofa, except for
the purpose of placing himself before his gods at the
dinner-table, now began to experience the impolicy
of feeding like an ogre in the deserts of the Tehama,
and very quickly fell a victim to his imprudence.</p>

<p>From Beit el Fakih they proceeded to Mokha,
where, as at Cairo, Europeans were compelled to
enter the city by a particular gate, on foot, as a mark
of humiliation. Niebuhr found that he and his
companions were here taken for Turks, and they
were accordingly directed to the khan, or inn, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the Osmanlis usually took up their abode. Though
they understood that there was an English merchant
at Mokha, they judged it unnecessary, in the first
instance, to make application to him, as they had
everywhere else in Yemen been received with
politeness and hospitality; and besides, they were
somewhat apprehensive that, from their dress and
appearance, he might be led to regard them as vagabonds
or renegades. They therefore addressed
themselves to an Arab merchant, by whom they
were well received.</p>

<p>The people of Mokha made some pretensions to
civilization, which is unfortunate, as the term, at
least in the East, means custom-house officers, and
insolence towards strangers. Our travellers, though
no merchants, had large quantities of baggage, which,
of course, was taken to the custom-house, before
they could be allowed to enjoy the use of it. I have
already observed, that although Niebuhr himself was
a temperate, perhaps even an abstemious man, his
companions set a high value on the gratification of
their senses. Von Haven himself, who, as I have
already observed, shortly afterward fell a victim to
his indiscretion, was still among them, and it may
therefore be easily imagined that the first articles they
were desirous of obtaining from the custom-house
were their cooking utensils and their beds. The
Arabs, however, were differently minded. They
allowed their curiosity to fasten upon the cases in
which the natural history specimens were packed, and
resolved to begin with them. Among these, unfortunately,
there was a small barrel containing various
fish of the Red Sea, preserved in spirits of wine.
This M. Forskaal, who had collected these fishes
himself, injudiciously requested the officers to allow
to pass unopened. The request immediately roused
all their suspicions. He might, for aught they knew,
be a magician, who had confined the Red Sea itself
in that barrel, for the purpose of carrying it off, with
all its fishes, into Europe. It behooved them, therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
to bestir themselves. Accordingly the barrel
was the first thing opened; but when the operation
had been performed, the result anticipated by the
naturalist was produced, for so pungent, so atrocious
a stink was emitted from the half-putrefied fish, that
the authorities very probably apprehended them to
be a troop of assassins, commissioned by the devil
to administer perdition through the nostrils to all
true believers. The custom-house officer, however,
confiding in the protection of the Prophet, determined
to brave the infernal odour, and in order to
explore the abomination to the bottom, took out the
horrid remains of the fish, and stirred up the liquor
with a piece of iron. The entreaties of the travellers
to have it put on one side probably caused them
to be regarded as ghouls, who made their odious
repasts upon such foul preparations. The Arab still
stirred and stirred, and at length in an inauspicious
moment upset the cask, and deluged the whole
custom-house with its contents. Had Mohammed
himself been boiled in this liquid, it could not have
smelt more execrably; we may therefore easily
imagine the disgust with which the grave assembly
beheld it flowing under their beards, infecting them
with a scent which it would take several dirrhems’
worth of perfume to remove. Their ill-humour was
increased when, on opening another cask, containing
insects, their nostrils were again saluted with a fresh
variety of stink, which they inferred must possess
peculiar charms for the nose of a Frank, since he
would travel so far to procure himself the enjoyment
of its savour. An idea now began to suggest itself
to the Arabs, which still further irritated them, which
was, that the insolent Franks had packed up these
odious things in order to insult the governor of the
city, at the expense of whose beard, it was not
doubted, they intended to amuse themselves. This
persuasion was fatal to many a cockleshell. They
mercilessly thrust down a pointed iron bar through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the collections, crushing shells, and beetles, and
spiders. The worst stroke of all, however, was yet
to come. This was the opening of a small cask,
in which several kinds of serpents were preserved
in spirits. Everybody was now terrified. It was
suggested that the Franks had no doubt come to the
city for the purpose of poisoning the inhabitants, and
had represented themselves as physicians in order
to commit their horrid crimes the more effectually.
Even the governor was now moved. In fact, his
anger was roused to such a pitch, that, though a
grave and pious man, he exclaimed, “By God, these
people shall not pass the night in our city!” The
custom-house was then closed.</p>

<p>While they were in this perplexity, one of their
servants arrived in great hurry and confusion, with
the news that their books and clothes had been
thrown out through the window at their lodgings,
and the door shut against them. They moreover
found, upon inquiry, that it would be difficult to
discover any person who would receive into his
house individuals suspected of meditating the poisoning
of the city; but at length a man bold enough
to undertake this was found. Such was their position
when they received from the English merchant
above alluded to an invitation to dinner. “Never,”
says Niebuhr, “was an invitation more gladly accepted;
for we not only found at his house a dinner
such as we had never seen since our departure from
Cairo, but had at the same time the good fortune to
meet with a man who became our sincere and faithful
friend. The affair of the custom-house was long
and tedious; but at length, by dint of bribery and
perseverance, their baggage, snakes and all, was
delivered to them, and they even rose, in consequence
of a cure attempted by M. Cramer on the governor’s
leg, into high consideration and favour.”</p>

<p>Niebuhr was here again attacked by dysentery,
and Von Haven died. This event inspired the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
party with terror, and having with much difficulty
obtained the governor’s permission, they shortly
afterward departed for the interior. They travelled
by night, to escape the extreme heat of the sun, but
soon found the roads so bad as to render this mode
of journeying impracticable. The country during
the early part of their route was barren, and but
thinly inhabited; but in proportion as they departed
from the shore the landscape improved in beauty
and fertility. At the small city of Jerim, on the
road to Sana, Niebuhr had the misfortune to lose
his friend Forskaal, the best Arabic scholar of the
whole party, and a man who looked forward with
enthusiasm to the glory to be derived from the successful
termination of their travels. The bigotry
of the Mohammedans rendered it difficult to obtain
a place of burial for the dead, who was interred in
the European fashion; which, immediately after their
departure, caused the Arabs, who imagine that Europeans
bury treasures with their dead, to exhume
the body. Finding nothing to reward their pains,
they compelled the Jews to reinter him; and as
these honest people complained that they were
likely to have no remuneration for their labour,
the governor allowed them to take the coffin in payment,
and restore the body naked to the earth.</p>

<p>On the 17th of July, 1763, they arrived in the
environs of Sana, and sent forward a servant with
a letter, announcing their arrival to the chief minister
of the imam. This statesman, however, who
had previously received tidings of their approach,
and was desirous of receiving them with true Arab
politeness, had already despatched one of his secretaries
to meet them at the distance of half a league
from the city. This gentleman informed them that
they had been long expected at Sana, and that, in
order to render their stay agreeable, the imam had
assigned them a country-house at <i>Bir el Assab</i>.
While they were conversing with the secretary, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
secretly congratulating themselves on their good
fortune, they arrived at the entrance into their garden,
where the Arab desired them to alight. They
of course obeyed, but soon discovered that their
guide had played them a trick in the manner of the
people of Cairo, for he remained on his ass during
the rest of the way, which was considerable, enjoying
the pleasure of beholding a number of Franks
toiling along on foot beside his beast. This put
them out of humour, and their spleen was increased
when, on arriving at their villa, they found that,
however elegant or agreeable it might be, it did not
contain a single article of furniture, or a person who
would provide them even with bread and water.</p>

<p>Next day, however, they received from the imam
a present of five sheep, three camel-loads of wood, a
large quantity of wax-tapers, rice, and spices. At
the same time they were informed that two days at
least would elapse before they could obtain an audience,
a matter about which they were indifferent;
but that they could not in the mean time quit their
house. Though considerably chagrined at the latter
circumstance, they hoped in some measure to neutralize
its effects, by receiving the visits of such natives
as curiosity, or any other motive, might allure
to the house; and accordingly were very much gratified
at the appearance of a Jew, who had performed
in their company the journey from Cairo to Loheia.
This young Israelite, delighted to spend a few moments
in the company of persons who received him
without any demonstrations of contempt, appeared
to experience a gratification in obliging them; and
came on the second day accompanied by one of the
most celebrated astrologers of his sect, from whom
Niebuhr learned the Hebrew appellations of several
stars. While he was yet conversing with this
learned descendant of Abraham, the secretary of the
imam arrived. They were ignorant of the etiquette
of the court of Sana, according to which they should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
have abstained from receiving as well as from paying
visits; but the secretary, whose business it was
to have instructed them on these points, doubly
enraged by their infraction of the rules of decorum,
and by a sense of his own negligence, directed all
the violence of his fury against the unfortunate
Jews, whose society he imagined must have been
equally disagreeable to the travellers as it would
have been to him. He therefore not only expelled
them from the house, but, in order to protect the
imam’s guests from a repetition of the same intrusion,
gave peremptory orders to their Mohammedan
attendant to admit no person whatever until they
should have obtained their audience.</p>

<p>Two days after their arrival they were admitted
into the presence of the imam. It is probable that,
having previously formed an exalted idea of the
splendour of oriental princes, the reader will be
liable to disappointment on the present occasion.
The riches and magnificence of the califs, however,
of which we find so many glowing descriptions in
the Thousand and One Nights, in D’Herbelot, and
many other writers, have long passed away, leaving
to the successors of those religious monarchs nothing
but remembrance of ancient glory, which
gleams like a meteoric light about their throne and
diadem. Niebuhr, arriving at Sana from the sandy
deserts of the Tehama, where poverty reigns paramount
over every thing, enjoyed the advantage of
possessing an imagination sobered by stern realities.
His fancy depicted the court of the imam in the
livery of the desert. He expected little. If he
was disappointed, therefore, it was not disagreeably.</p>

<p>The imam, with a vanity pardonable enough in a
prince who learns from his cradle to estimate his
own greatness by the pomp and glitter which surround
him, had in fact employed the two days elapsed
since the arrival of his guests in active preparations
for their reception; and the rules of etiquette forbidding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
strangers to pay or receive visits during the
interval, were originally intended to conceal this
circumstance, and create the belief that the holyday
appearance of the court was its ordinary costume.
Our travellers were conducted to the palace by the
minister’s secretary, who here performed what is
called the mehmandar’s office in Persia. They
found the great court of the edifice thronged with
horses, officers, and other Arabs of various grades;
so that it required the ministry of the imam’s grand
equerry to open them a way through the crowd. The
hall of audience was a spacious square apartment,
vaulted above, and having on its centre several fountains
of water, which, gushing aloft to a considerable
height, and falling again incessantly, maintained a
refreshing coolness in the air. A broad divan,
adorned with fine Persian carpets, occupied the
extremity of the hall, and flanked the throne, which
was merely covered with silken stuffs, and rich
cushions. Here the imam sat cross-legged, according
to the custom of the East. He received the
travellers graciously, allowed them to kiss the hem
of his garment, and the back and palm of his hand&mdash;an
honour which is but sparingly granted to strangers.
At the conclusion of this ceremony a herald
cried aloud, “God save the imam!” and all the people
repeated the same words. As their knowledge
of Arabic was still very limited, they conversed
with the imam by means of an interpreter, a contrivance
admirably adapted for shortening public conferences,
since there are few persons who, under
such circumstances, would be disposed to indulge in
useless circumlocution.</p>

<p>The result of this audience was, that they obtained
the prince’s permission to remain in the country
as long as they desired; and on their retiring, a
small present in money was sent them, which they
judiciously determined to accept. In the afternoon
of the same day they were invited to the minister’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
villa, where Niebuhr exhibited his mathematical instruments,
his microscopes, books, engravings, &amp;c.;
at the sight of which Fakih Achmed expressed the
highest satisfaction. From the various questions
which he put to them, they discovered, moreover,
that he himself was a man of very considerable
knowledge, particularly in geography; while from
his constant intercourse with foreigners his manners
had acquired an ease and gracefulness which rendered
his company highly pleasing. Nevertheless,
Niebuhr, who feared that the cupidity of this minister,
or of some other courtier, might be excited by
the sight of his instruments, regretted to perceive
these tokens of curiosity, and the necessity he was
under of satisfying it; but his suspicions, which appear
to have been as unfounded as they were illiberal,
were not of long duration, for no man demanded of
him any part of his property, or seemed to regard it
with covetousness. He, in fact, learned shortly
afterward that even the presents which it was
judged necessary to make both to the imam and his
minister were altogether unexpected, since they
were not merchants, and demanded no favours of
prince or courtiers.</p>

<p>Niebuhr confesses that the reception which he
and his companions met with at Sana was marked
by a degree of civility and friendship that far surpassed
their expectations. The Arabs would seem,
indeed, to have derived so much gratification from
their society, that it is more than probable they would
willingly have made some sacrifice to retain them;
but the death of Von Haven and Forskaal had cast a
damp over their imaginations; they apprehended
that disease might even then be undermining their
constitutions, and were therefore more desirous of
flying from the country than of studying its productions
or its inhabitants. When they departed from
Mokha several English ships were lying there,
taking in cargoes of coffee for India; and this circumstance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
by promising to facilitate their progress
farther towards the east, operated strongly upon
their determination to quit Arabia, the original object
of their mission, for other regions which appeared
more agreeable. One of Niebuhr’s biographers appears
to think that it was mere solicitude to transmit
to Europe an account of what had been performed
by the expedition, and not any apprehension of danger,
which rendered him so exceedingly desirous
of quitting Yemen, for that he never clung to life
with any great eagerness. I have by no means an
unfavourable opinion of Niebuhr’s courage, which,
on the contrary, I consider to have been in general
equal to the dangers to which he was exposed; but
I nowhere find any traces of that stoical indifference
about life and death which his biographer seems to
attribute to him; and am persuaded, that on the occasion
of his departure from Sana, it was the apprehension
of death, united, perhaps, with a longing for
European society, which actuated his movements.
At the same time I acknowledge that his fears
were natural, and that most travellers under similar
circumstances would have acted much the same
way. We miss, however, in Niebuhr, both on this
and on all other occasions, the chivalrous spirit of
Marco Polo, Pietro della Valle, Chardin, and Bruce,
as we miss in his writings the enthusiasm which
casts so powerful a charm over the records of their
adventures.</p>

<p>The same reasons which induce me to acknowledge
the rational nature of Niebuhr’s apology for
suddenly quitting Yemen long before he had completed
his examination and description of it, incline
me likewise to accept his reasons for avoiding the
road by Jerim and Táäs, which would have led him
by Haddâfa and Dhâfar, where Hamyaric inscriptions
were said to exist. He had already been frequently
deceived by the misrepresentations of Arabic
ignorance, and therefore doubted the accuracy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of his informants. The three remaining members
of the mission set out from Sana on the 26th of
July, and, arriving at Mokha on the 5th of August,
found that their apprehensions of danger at Sana,
which, though excusable, were not well founded, had
precipitated them into real peril; for the English
ship in which they intended to embark was by no
means ready to sail, so that they had to remain in
that burning climate nearly a whole month, during
which almost every individual in the party, servants
and all, fell sick.</p>

<p>The ship in which Niebuhr at length set sail for
India belonged to Mr. Francis Scott, a younger son
of the Scotts of Harden, a jacobite family of Roxburghshire.
With this gentleman Niebuhr ever after
lived on terms of intimate friendship; and “five-and-thirty
years afterward,” says our traveller’s
son, the historian of the Roman republic, “when I
studied in Edinburgh, I was received in all respects
as one of the family in the house of this venerable
man, who then lived at his ease in the Scottish
capital on the fortune he had acquired by honourable
industry.”</p>

<p>On his arrival at Bombay he met with the most
cordial reception from the English, in whose society
he had first learned to delight while in Egypt.
Here he spent a considerable time in studying the
manners and customs of the Hindoos, and his observations,
though now destitute of value, must at
that time have possessed considerable interest, above
all on the Continent. He here lost Cramer, the last
of his companions; Baurenfeind, the artist, having
died on the voyage. During his stay at Bombay he
made a voyage to Surat, famous in the history of
oriental commerce and in the Arabian Nights; but
his stay was short, and he returned to Bombay
without pushing his researches any farther into the
interior. The passion for travelling was certainly
never very powerful in Niebuhr; but he was posessed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
by considerable curiosity, and this passion
induced him to form the design of proceeding in an
English ship to China; but being unwell at the time
of the ship’s departure, he relinquished the design,
which he never afterward resumed.</p>

<p>His residence at Bombay, a much less healthy
place than Sana, was continued so long, that I am
strongly inclined to suspect the want of European
society may, after all, have numbered among his most
powerful reasons for hurrying from Yemen. From
this city he forwarded the manuscripts of his deceased
companions as well as his own papers, by
way of London, to Copenhagen; and at length, on
the 8th of December, 1764, set sail in one of the
company’s ships of war, bound for Muskat and the
Persian Gulf. During this voyage he beheld the
surface of the sea for half a German mile in extent
covered at night with that luminous appearance
which we denominate “phosphoric fires;” and which,
according to his opinion, arises entirely from shoals
of medusas, which by the English sailors are called
“blubbers.” A few days afterward, as they approached
the shore of Oman, they were accompanied
for a considerable distance by a troop of dolphins,
which, by the persevering manner in which they followed
the ship, seemed, as Lucian jocularly observes,
to be animated by a kind of philanthropy, as when
they bore Melicerta and Arion to the shore on their
backs.</p>

<p>They arrived at Muskat on the 3d of January,
1765; and here Niebuhr, had the interior of Arabia
possessed any attractions for him, had once more
an opportunity of indulging his curiosity, and fulfilling
the original design of the expedition; for, from
the humane and polished manners of the people of
Oman, travelling was here, he says, attended with
no more danger than in Yemen. He preferred,
however, ascending the Persian Gulf in an English
ship; and therefore, after a stay of a few days, set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
sail for Abusheher, where he arrived on the 4th of
February.</p>

<p>Here Niebuhr, who had learned the English language
at Bombay, found himself still in the company
of one of our countrymen, from whom he obtained
a plan of the city, together with much curious and
valuable information respecting the country and its
inhabitants. This Englishman, whose name was
Jervis, spoke, read, and wrote the Persian with fluency,
and amused himself with making a collection
of manuscripts in that language; among which was
the “Life of Nadir Shah,” by his own private secretary
Mohammed Mahadi Khan. The authenticity
of this work was so highly spoken of in Persia, that
Niebuhr was at some pains to procure a copy of it for
the King of Denmark’s library; and it was from this
copy that Sir William Jones afterward compiled his
“History of Nadir Shah,” once celebrated, but now
sunk into oblivion. At Abusheher our traveller saw
several of that species of cat numbers of which are
now brought into Europe from Angola. They were
procured from Kermân, and it was said that they
would nowhere breed except in those countries in
which the shawl goat was found&mdash;an opinion which
has long been proved to have been erroneous.</p>

<p>Shortly after Niebuhr’s arrival at Abusheher, Mr.
Jervis determined upon sending a quantity of merchandise
to Shiraz; and his intention was no sooner
made public, than a number of petty merchants,
together with several families from the interior, who
had been expelled from their homes by the troubles
consequent upon the death of Nadir Shah, desired
to unite themselves to his party; and thus a small
kafilah was at once formed. So excellent an opportunity
of visiting the most beautiful city of Persia,
as well as the famous ruins of Persepolis, was not
to be overlooked. Our traveller therefore joined the
trading caravan, and on the 15th of February set out
for the interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>For this journey, however, he was but badly prepared.
He was wholly ignorant of the Persian language,
and therefore, had he not by great good fortune
found some persons among the party who spoke
Arabic, as well as an Armenian who was a tolerable
master of the Italian, he must have been reduced to
depend upon the universal but scanty language of
signs. Strange to say, likewise, he had abandoned
the oriental costume, though fully aware, by his own
account, of the advantages to be derived from it by
a traveller. In other respects he conducted himself
judiciously; for, understanding that the English, notwithstanding
the troubled state of Persia, had nowhere
any thing to fear, he represented himself as
an Englishman; and thus, without passport or formal
permission, he travelled with perfect freedom
and safety. He observed during this journey a curious
superstition among the Armenians, of which
he had nowhere else discovered any traces: having
despatched his servant upon some business at a distance
from the encampment, he was one day compelled
to act as his own cook, and was about to cut
off the head of a fowl. His face at that moment
happening to be turned towards the west, an Armenian
who was present informed him that a Christian
should turn his face to the east when he killed a
fowl, no less than when he prayed. Others (as the
affair was a serious business) conjectured that he
turned towards Mecca, either that his servant, who
was a Mohammedan, might conscientiously partake
of the food, or because that in reality was his <i>kebleh</i>.
Seeing, however, that people endeavoured to decide
respecting his religion by the mode in which he
slaughtered a hen, he for the future relinquished to
his servant the art and mystery of cookery.</p>

<p>Our traveller had an opportunity, near Firashbend,
of visiting a Turkoman camp. He found them rich
in camels, horses, asses, cows, and sheep. Their
women, like those of the Bedouins, enjoyed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
most perfect liberty, and wore no veils. These Turkoman
women were said to be exceedingly laborious,
and the small carpets so universal in Persia
were of their workmanship. He likewise beheld a
Kurdish family. Farther on, he had a very laughable
adventure with a troop of Armenian women, which,
as characteristic at once of the Armenians and of
himself, merits some attention. Having travelled
for some time through rain and hail, the kafilah at
length halted, near the village of <i>Romshun</i>, in which
Niebuhr hired a horse for a day, and purchased a
quantity of wood, in the hope of enjoying a good
fire until bedtime. Not desiring, however, to taste
of these blessings alone, he invited several Armenians
to share the advantage of his apartments,
which they most readily accepted. Presently, however,
a number of women and children presented
themselves for admission, and appeared extremely
well satisfied when he granted them permission to
place themselves inside of the door. He had shortly
afterward occasion to leave the house for a moment.
Upon his return, he found the husbands of
the women seated near the entrance of the house,
while the whole harem had established itself round
the fire! and conceiving that it might be imprudent
to sit down by the fire among the women, or to
drive them away from it, he allowed them, though
certainly not from politeness, to dry themselves
first. Here he was detained for twenty-four hours
by bad weather. The apartments which he occupied
were on the second story, and his horse, which
had its quarters in the adjoining chamber, being
somewhat restless in the night, broke through the
floor, and fell down into the landlord’s apartment
below!</p>

<p>The kafilah reached Shiraz on the 4th of March.
Here he was hospitably received and entertained by
the only European in the city, a young English merchant,
whose name he should have been at the pains
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
to learn, for assuredly it was not, as he imagined,
<i>Mr. Hercules</i>. His stay at Shiraz was rendered
agreeable by the politeness of the governor, who,
at his first audience, informed him that he would
decapitate the first person who should offer him any
injury in his territories. The audience being over,
one of the governor’s friends undertook to show
them the palace. Several of the apartments were
coated with beautiful Tabriz marble, and covered
with magnificent carpets; and among the ornaments
of the palace were numerous European mirrors,
and pictures of Persian workmanship, among
which was one representing a woman bathing, almost
wholly naked. Niebuhr was greatly surprised
to find pictures of this kind in the house of a Mohammedan;
but, in fact, the <i>Shiahs</i> are far less rigid
on this point than the <i>Soonnees</i>; and we learn from
the Arabian Nights, that even so early as the time
of Haroon al Rashid painting was encouraged in
Persia and Mesopotamia, since that celebrated prince
is said to have adorned his palace with the performances
of the principal Persian artists.</p>

<p>From Shiraz he proceeded to the ruins of Persepolis,
the site and nature of which I have already
had occasion to describe in the lives of Chardin and
Kæmpfer. His head-quarters during his stay was
at the small village of Merdast. From thence, as
well as from the other villages, the peasants frequently
came to observe him during his examination
of the ruins, in which he constantly employed the
whole day, from eight o’clock in the morning until
five in the afternoon. The majority of these visiters
were women and young girls, who were curious
to see a European; and the whole of the population
were so entirely harmless, that the traveller felt
himself as safe in their company as he could have
been in any village in Europe. He here received a
visit from an Arab sheïkh, a learned, polished, and
agreeable man, who had passed thirty years in Persia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
during which time he had amassed considerable
wealth, and now lived in independence and ease.</p>

<p>From Persepolis he returned by the way of Shiraz
to Abusheher, where he embarked in one of the
country vessels for the island of Karak, where he
was hospitably received and entertained by the
Dutch merchants settled there; and after a short
stay, proceeded to Bassorah. Here he embarked in
a small vessel which was about to sail up the Euphrates
to Hillah. His companion, during this voyage,
was an officer of the janizary corps, who lay
in a small chamber close to Niebuhr’s cabin, and appeared
to be at the point of death. In other respects
this little voyage, which occupied twenty-one
days, was sufficiently agreeable. The passengers
were remarkable for their good-humour and
obliging disposition; and often, when our traveller
set up his quadrant on the banks of the stream, they
stood round him in a circle, while he was making
his observations, to screen him from the wind with
their long flowing dresses.</p>

<p>At Rumahia, a small village on the Euphrates, he
lodged with two of his Mohammedan companions
at the house of a Soonnee, who happened to be the
<i>moollah</i> of a mosque. Soon after their arrival, our
traveller entered into conversation with his host,
and their discourse turning on the subject of marriage,
he observed, among other things, that in Europe
a man, when he gives his daughter to any one
in wedlock, is generally accustomed to add a considerable
sum of money. This custom greatly delighted
the moollah. “Do you hear,” says he to
his mother-in-law, who was sitting near him, while
the daughter was preparing their <i>pilau</i>,&mdash;“do you
hear what the stranger is saying? It was not thus
that you acted towards me, my mother; I was compelled
to pay you a sum of money before you would
give me your daughter!” The mother-in-law, after
patiently hearing him to the end, replied, “Ah! my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
son, upon what should I and my daughter have
subsisted, had I given thee my field and my date-trees?”
This slight interruption in the conversation
having ceased, Niebuhr, resuming the thread of
the discourse, remarked, that in Europe no man
could possess more than one wife, under pain of
death; that married persons enjoyed every thing in
common; and that their property descended to their
children. It was now the old lady’s turn to be eloquent.
“Well, my son,” says she, “have you
marked what the gentleman has just related? Ah!
what justice prevails in those countries! Ah! had
you no other wife than my daughter, and could I be
sure you would never divorce her, how willingly
would I relinquish to you my house, and all I possess!”
The young woman, who had hitherto seemed
to pay no attention to what was said, now likewise
joined in the discussion. “Alas! my husband!”
said she, “how can you desire that my mother
should give you her house? You would soon bestow
it upon your other wives. You love them better
than me. I see you so seldom!”</p>

<p>The mother and daughter proceeded in this style
for some time, and at length Niebuhr, turning to the
moollah, demanded how many wives he had.&mdash;“Four,”
replied the man. This was the highest
number permitted by the law. He had, therefore,
indulged his affections to the utmost; and as each
of his spouses had a separate house and garden, he
flitted at pleasure from wife to wife, and was everywhere
received as a man returning home from a long
journey. Our traveller inquired of this zealous polygamist
whether his private happiness had been increased
or diminished by his having availed himself
of the privilege of a Mohammedan; but, because
his reply was contrary to his own European views,
as that of every other Mussulman, whom he had
questioned on the subject, had been, he absurdly accused
him of insincerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>From this place he proceeded to <i>Meshed Ali</i>,
where he was deterred from entering the mosque,
by the fear that he might, as a punishment for his
presumption, be compelled to profess Mohammedanism;
but he admired the exterior of its gilded
dome, which glittered like a globe of flame in the
sun. The riches of this mosque, allowing much for
the exaggeration of the <i>Shiahs</i>, must still be immense.
The interior of the dome is no less superbly
gilt than the exterior, and is adorned with
Arabic inscriptions in rich enamel; other inscriptions,
in letters of gold, glitter along the walls;
while enormous candelabra, in silver and fine gold,
set with jewels, support the tapers which afford
light to the pious during the darkness of the night.
This accumulation of gorgeous ornaments, though
supplied from a commendable motive, affects the
worshippers injuriously, and once occasioned a
pious Arab to exclaim, “Verily, the treasures lavished
upon this tomb have made me forget God!”</p>

<p>Niebuhr next visited the ruins of Kufa, and Meshed
Hussein, and then returned to Hillah, near
which are found the misshapen ruins of Babylon.
We must not, as he justly observes, expect to find
among the remains of this city any thing resembling
the sublime magnificence which cast a halo over the
ruins of Persian and Egyptian cities. Babylon, like
modern London, was a city of bricks, prodigious in
extent, mighty in appearance, but calculated, from
the nature of its materials, to give way, when war
or time laid its giant hands upon its towers. Its
very site is now become an enigma, “a place for the
bittern, and pools of water.” Modern travellers,
however, have since visited this celebrated spot, and
described it so frequently, that it is unnecessary to
pause and repeat what they have written, particularly
as no two agree upon any one point.</p>

<p>His stay at Babylon was brief, and on the 5th of
January, 1766, he left it to proceed towards Bagdad,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
where he remained until the 3d of March, awaiting
the departure of a caravan for Syria. At length,
finding no better companions, he departed with a
kafilah composed wholly of Jews, from one of
whom, who had travelled much in the country, he
expected to derive considerable information. He
still possessed the sultan’s firman, which he had
procured at Constantinople, and had likewise provided
himself with a passport from the Pasha of
Bagdad. He therefore anticipated no interruption
on the way. In proceeding from Bagdad to Mousul,
he traversed the plain on which the great battle
of Arbela, which reduced Persia to a Macedonian
province, was gained by Alexander. Ruin and desolation
have since that day been busily at work in
these countries. Among the vagabonds who now
roam over or vegetate upon these renowned scenes,
are a strange people, accused by many writers of
worshipping the devil; I mean the <i>Yezeedis</i>, who,
though suspected by Niebuhr of being an offshoot
from the Beyazi sect of Oman, appear to be rather
the descendants of the ancient Manichæans, or a
remnant of the Hindoo population, worshippers of
<i>Siva</i>, hurled into this obscure haunt by the storms
of war.</p>

<p>At Mousul, where he found numerous Catholic
and Nestorian Christians, he was received with
extreme scorn, because his worthy coreligionists
learned that he did not fast during Lent. However,
by allowing himself to be defrauded a little by a
Dominican father, a dealer in coins and physic, he
quickly regained his character, and, during the remainder
of his stay, was reputed a very good Christian.
From this city he departed with a numerous
caravan, bound partly for Aleppo, partly for Mardin,
Orfah, or Armenia. The whole number of the
travellers, including a guard of fifty soldiers, and
about three or four hundred Arabs, amounted to
little less than a thousand men. Yet, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
their numbers, the slightest report of there being
a horde of Kurds in their neighbourhood threw
these gallant warriors into consternation, and, upon
one particular occasion, their confusion was so extreme
that, like the honest knight of La Mancha,
they mistook a flock of sheep for an army. The
robbers on this road are exceedingly expert in their
vocation; and one of the merchants of the caravan,
who had often travelled by this route, amused Niebuhr
with an anecdote illustrative of their skill,
which deserves to be repeated:&mdash;He was one night
encamped, he said, on the summit of a steep hill,
and for the greater security had pitched his tent on
the edge of the precipice. He himself kept watch
until midnight, at which time he was relieved by his
servant, who, as it would appear, soon fell asleep.
On awaking about daybreak he observed a robber in
the tent. He had already fastened the hook, with
which he meant to perform his feat, in a bale of
merchandise; but sprang out of the tent, upon perceiving
he was discovered, still holding fast the
cord of his hook. The merchant, however, immediately
detached the hook from the bale, and fastened
it in the clothes of his slumbering domestic,
who, as the robber continued tugging violently at
the cord, was soon roused. The robber pulled, the
servant rolled along like a woolsack, and the master
had the satisfaction of seeing him tumble down to
the bottom of the hill, that he might in future be
somewhat more careful of his master’s property.</p>

<p>Niebuhr himself, whose cautious temper generally
defended him from danger, had on this journey
a trifling adventure with an Arab sheïkh. It entered
into the head of this fiery young Islamite that
it would be amusing to have a frolic with a Giaour,
and for this purpose he deprived our traveller of his
bed and counterpanes. Niebuhr complained to the
caravan bashi, but could only get a portion of his
property restored. Next day, therefore, he applied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
to the sheïkh himself, who, instead of returning
the articles, only jested with him upon his uncharitable
disposition, which would not allow him
to share his luxuries, even for a few days, with a
true believer, who was willing to be condescending
enough to sleep on the bed of an infidel. Our traveller,
hoping to terrify the Arab, now produced the
sultan’s firman, and the Pasha of Bagdad’s passport;
but this only rendered matters worse. “Here
in the desert,” said the sheïkh, “<i>I</i> am thy sultan
and thy pasha. Thy papers have no authority with
me!” Some days afterward, however, the Arab
returned him his effects, from fear, according to
Niebuhr, of the Governor of Mardin; but more
probably because he had never intended to retain
them.</p>

<p>From this point of his travels he proceeded by
way of Mardin, Diarbekr, and Orfah, to Aleppo,
where he arrived on the 6th of June. Here he remained
some time, during which he acquired the
friendship of the celebrated Dr. Patrick Russel,
from whom he received much information respecting
the Kurds and Turkomans, whose principal
chiefs frequently visited our distinguished countryman
at his house. His inquiries likewise extended
to the Nassaireah and Ismaeleah, who, from the accounts
of the Mohammedans and oriental Christians,
would appear to have preserved among them
the rites and ceremonies of the ancient worshippers
of Venus. Nocturnal orgies, in which every
man chose his mistress in the dark, and the adoration
of the Yoni, in a young woman who exposed
herself naked for the purpose of receiving this extravagant
reverence, were likewise attributed to
them; but, as Niebuhr observes, there is nothing
too absurd or abominable to be related by the orthodox
and dominant party of a persecuted heretical
sect. He, in fact, found that the Roman Catholics
everywhere in the East represented their Protestant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
brethren as persons who lived without hope and
without God in the world; while we, on the other
hand, look upon them as idolaters, as far removed
as the pagans of old from the pure religion of Christ.</p>

<p>After the death of his companions, Niebuhr had
applied to the Danish government for permission to
extend his journey in the East, and, through the benevolence
of Count Bernstorf, his wishes had been
readily complied with. He therefore passed from
Syria into Cyprus, for the purpose of copying certain
Phenician inscriptions at Cittium, the birth-place
of Zeno, which had, it was suspected, been
incorrectly copied by Pococke. Finding no inscriptions
of the kind on the spot to which he had been
directed, he, with an illiberality which was not
common with him, imputed to Pococke the gross absurdity
of having confounded Armenian with Phenician
characters; but, as his recent biographer remarks,
it is more probable that the stones had, in
the interval, been removed.</p>

<p>From Cyprus he passed over into Palestine,
visited Jerusalem, Sidon, Mount Lebanon, and Damascus,
and then returned to Aleppo. Here he continued
until the 20th of November, 1766, when he
set out with a caravan for Brusa, in Asia Minor;
and in traversing the table-land of Mount Taurus,
suffered, says one of his biographers, as much from
frosts, piercing winds, and snow-drifts, as he could
have done in a winter journey in northern regions.
Lofty mountains are everywhere cold. Chardin
nearly perished among the snows of Mount Caucasus;
Don Ulloa suffered severely from the same
cause in the Andes, almost directly under the equator;
and the lofty range of the Himalaya, which
divides Hindostan from Tibet, is so excessively
cold, that Baber Khan, though a soldier and a Tartar,
beheld with terror the obstacle which these mountains
presented to his ambition; and their summits
have hitherto been protected by cold from human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
intrusion. Upon reaching Brusa, however, he reposed
himself for some time, and then set out for
Constantinople, where he arrived on the 20th of
February, 1767.</p>

<p>Here he remained three or four months, studying
the institutions of the empire, civil and military. He
then directed his course through Roumelia, Bulgaria,
Wallachia, and Moldavia, towards Poland, and on
arriving at Warsaw was received with extraordinary
politeness by King Stanislaus Poniatowsky, with
whom he afterward corresponded for many years.
From Warsaw he continued his journey towards
Copenhagen, and visited on the way Göttingen and
his beloved native place, when the death of his
mother’s brother, during his absence, had left him in
possession of a considerable marsh-farm. He arrived
at Copenhagen in November, and was received in
the most flattering manner by the court, the ministers,
and men of science.</p>

<p>Niebuhr now employed himself in preparing his
various works for publication. The “Description
of Arabia” was published in 1772, and although it
must unquestionably be regarded as one of the most
exact and copious works of the kind ever composed
on any Asiatic country, it met with but a cold reception
from the public. This, however, is not at
all surprising. Written in the old style of books of
travels, which appear to have aimed at imparting
instruction without at all interesting the imagination,
it can never be relished by the generality of readers,
who at all times, and especially in these latter ages,
have required to be cheated into knowledge by the
secret but irresistible charms of composition. Niebuhr,
unfortunately, possessed in a very limited degree
the art of an author. His style has nothing of
that life and vivacity which compensates, in many
writers, for the want of method. But those who
neglect his works on these accounts are to be pitied;
for they abound with information, and everywhere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
exhibit marks of a remarkable power of penetrating
into the character and motives of men, and a noble,
manly benevolence, which generally inclines to a
favourable, but just interpretation. He understood
the Arabs better than almost any other traveller, and
his opinion of them upon the whole was remarkably
favourable. It is to him, therefore, that in an attempt
to appreciate the character of this extraordinary
people, I would resort, in preference even to
Volney, who, whatever might be the perspicuity of
his mind, had far fewer data whereon to found his
conclusions.</p>

<p>In 1773 he married, and his wife bore him two
children, a daughter and B. G. Niebuhr, the author
of the “Roman History.” Next year the first volume
of his “Travels” appeared, and was received by the
public no less coldly than the “Description of Arabia;”
which was, perhaps, the cause why the second
volume was not published until 1778; and why the
third, which would have completed his “Travels’”
history, was never laid before the world, or even
prepared for publication. This is exceedingly to be
regretted, as, whatever may be the defects of Niebuhr
as an author, which it appeared to be my duty
to explain, he was, as an observer, highly distinguished
for sagacity; and his account of Asia Minor
would have been still valuable, notwithstanding all
that has since been written on that country.</p>

<p>He continued to live at Copenhagen for ten years;
but at length the retirement of Count Bernstorf from
the ministry, and a report that General Huth designed
to despatch him into Norway for the purpose
of making a geographical survey of that country,
disgusted him with the capital. He therefore demanded
of the government permission to exchange
his military for a civil appointment, and accordingly
obtained the situation of secretary of the district of
Meldorf, whither he removed his family in the year
1778. This town afforded Niebuhr few opportunities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
of entering into society. He consequently
endeavoured to extract from solitude and from study
the pleasures which he could not take in the company
of mankind, and addicted himself to gardening
and books. When his children had reached an age
to require instruction, he undertook to conduct their
education himself. “He instructed us,” says his son,
“in geography, and related to us many passages of
history. He taught me English and French&mdash;better,
at any rate, than they would have been taught by
anybody else in such a place; and something of
mathematics, in which he would have proceeded
much further, had not want of zeal and desire in me
unfortunately destroyed all his pleasure in the occupation.
One thing, indeed, was characteristic of his
whole system of teaching: as he had no idea how
anybody could have knowledge of any kind placed
before him, and not seize it with the greatest avidity,
and hold to it with the steadiest perseverance, he
became disinclined to teach whenever we appeared
inattentive or reluctant to learn. As the first instruction
I received in Latin, before I had the good
fortune to become a scholar of the learned and excellent
Jäger, was very defective, he helped me, and
read with me “Cæsar’s Commentaries.” Here
again, the peculiar bent of his mind showed itself:
he always called my attention much more strongly
to the geography than the history. The map of
Ancient Gaul by D’Anville, for whom he had the
greatest reverence, always lay before us. I was
obliged to look out every place as it occurred, and to
tell its exact situation. His instruction had no pretensions
to be grammatical; his knowledge of the
language, so far as it went, was gained entirely by
reading, and by looking at it as a whole. He was
of opinion that a man did not deserve to learn what
he had not principally worked out for himself; and
that a teacher should be only a helper to assist the
pupil out of otherwise inexplicable difficulties. From
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
these causes his attempts to teach me Arabic, when
he had already lost that facility in speaking it without
which it is impossible to dispense with grammatical
instruction, to his disappointment and my
shame, did not succeed. When I afterward taught
it myself, and sent him translations from it, he was
greatly delighted.</p>

<p>“I have the most lively recollection of many descriptions
of the structure of the universe, and accounts
of eastern countries, which he used to tell me
instead of fairy tales, when he took me on his knee
before I went to bed. The history of Mohammed;
of the first califs, particularly of Omar and Ali, for
whom he had the deepest veneration; of the conquests
and spread of Islamism; of the virtues of the
heroes of the new faith, and of the Turkish converts,
were imprinted on my childish imagination in the
liveliest colours. Historical works on these same
subjects were nearly the first books that fell into my
hands.</p>

<p>“I recollect, too, that on the Christmas-eve of my
tenth year, by way of making the day one of peculiar
solemnity and rejoicing to me, he went to a beautiful
chest containing his manuscripts, which was regarded
by us children, and indeed by the whole
household, as a kind of ark of the covenant; took
out the papers relating to Africa, and read to me
from them. He had taught me to draw maps, and
with his encouragement and assistance I soon produced
maps of Habbesh and Soudan.</p>

<p>“I could not make him a more welcome birthday
present than a sketch of the geography of eastern
countries, or translations from voyages and travels,
executed as might be expected from a child. He
had originally no stronger desire than that I might
be his successor as a traveller in the East. But the
influence of a very tender and anxious mother upon
my physical training and constitution, thwarted his
plan, almost as soon as it was formed. In consequence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of her opposition, my father afterward gave
up all thoughts of it.</p>

<p>“The distinguished kindness he had experienced
from the English, and the services which he had
been able to render to the East India Company, by
throwing light upon the higher part of the Red Sea,
led him to entertain the idea of sending me, as soon
as I was old enough, to India. With this scheme,
which, plausible as it was, he was afterward as glad
to see frustrated as I was myself, many things, in
the education he gave me, was intimately connected.
He taught me, by preference, out of English books,
and put English works, of all sorts, into my hands.
At a very early age he gave me a regular supply of
English newspapers: circumstances which I record
here, not on account of the powerful influence they
have had on my maturer life, but as indications of
his character.”</p>

<p>In the winter of 1788 he received from Herder a
copy of his “Persepolis,” which afforded him one
proof that he was not forgotten by his countrymen.
He took a deep interest in the war which was then
raging against Turkey; for, in proportion to his love
for the Arabs, was his hatred of the Turks, whom he
cordially desired to see expelled from Europe. The
French expedition to Egypt, however, was no object
of gratification to him; for his dislike of the French
was as strong as his dislike of the Turks, convinced
that their absurd vanity and want of faith would
infallibly neutralize the good effects even of the
revolution itself. I am sorry to discover that, among
other prejudices, he was led, partly, perhaps, from
vanity, to accuse Bruce of having copied his astronomical
observations; of having fabricated his conversation
with Ali Bey; as well as, to borrow the
strange language of his recent English biographer,
“the pretended <i>journey over the Red Sea</i>, in <i>the country
of Bab el Mandeb</i>, as well as that on the coast
south from Cosseir.” The same writer informs us that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
“Niebuhr read Bruce’s work <i>without prejudice</i>, and
the conclusion he arrived at was the same which is,
since the second Edinburgh edition, and the publication
of Salt’s two journeys, <i>the universal and ultimate
one</i>.” During the composition of these Lives, I have
almost constantly avoided every temptation to engage
in controversy with any man; I hope, likewise,
that I have escaped from another, and still
stronger temptation, to exalt my own countrymen
at the expense of foreigners; but I cannot regard it
as my duty, on the present occasion, to permit to
pass unnoticed what appears to me a mere ebullition
of envy in Niebuhr, and of weakness and want of
reflection in his biographer. What is meant by a
“<i>journey over the Red Sea?</i>” And where does
Bruce pretend to have travelled in the “<i>country</i> of
<i>Bab el Mandeb?</i>” These Arabic words are, I believe,
by oriental scholars acknowledged to signify the
“Gate of Tears,” and were anciently applied to what
is commonly called the “Strait of Bab el Mandel,”
from the belief that those who issued through that
strait into the ocean could never return. The biographer
seems to misunderstand the state of the question.
Bruce has often been charged with never having
sailed down the Red Sea so far as the strait,
notwithstanding his assertions in the affirmative.
But who are his accusers? Lord Valentia, Salt, and
others of that stamp; men who never dared to venture
their beards amid the dangers which Bruce
encountered intrepidly. With respect to the coast
from Cosseir southward, what, I will venture to
inquire, could Niebuhr have known about the matter?
Had he ever set his foot upon it? Had he even
beheld it from a distance? If he relied, as in fact he
did, upon the testimony of others, who were they?
what were their opportunities? and what their claims
to be believed? I am far from insinuating that
Lord Valentia and Mr. Salt have entered into a conspiracy
to wound the memory of Bruce; but, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
adopt the language of an old orator, I would ask
these gentlemen if they themselves could have been
guilty of the impudent mendacity which they impute
to Bruce? If, as there can be no doubt on the subject,
Lord Valentia and Mr. Salt would spurn the
imputation, is it to be for a moment believed that
the discoverer of the sources of the Nile, the honourable,
the fearless, the brave Bruce, could have
condescended to do what these individuals, who,
compared with him, are insignificant and obscure,
would, by their own confession, have shrunk from
perpetrating? But my unwillingness to speak harshly
of Niebuhr, whose name ranks with me among
those of the most honest and useful of travellers,
forbids me to carry this discussion any further. I
honour him for his knowledge, for his integrity, for
his high sense of honour; but, for this very reason, I
vehemently condemn his unjust attack upon the
memory of our illustrious traveller. The opinion of
his recent biographer, an able and, I make no doubt,
a conscientious man, appears evidently to have
arisen from an imperfect knowledge of the subject,
and is therefore the less entitled to consideration.</p>

<p>The account given by his distinguished son of the
latter days of this meritorious traveller is worthy
of finding a place here. “His appearance,” says
he, “was calculated to leave a delightful picture in
the mind. All his features, as well as his extinguished
eyes, wore the expression of the extreme
and exhausted old age of an extraordinarily robust
nature. It was impossible to behold a more venerable
sight. So venerable was it, that a Cossack
who entered an unbidden guest into the chamber
where he sat with his silver locks uncovered, was
so struck with it, that he manifested the greatest
reverence for him, and a sincere and cordial interest
for the whole household. His sweetness of temper
was unalterable, though he often expressed his desire
to go to his final home, since all which he had
desired to live for had been accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“A numerous, and as yet unbroken, family circle
was assembled around him; and every day in which
he was not assailed by some peculiar indisposition
he conversed with cheerfulness and cordial enjoyment
on the happy change which had taken place in
public affairs. We found it very delightful to engage
in continued recitals of his travels, which he
now related with peculiar fulness and vivacity. In
this manner he once spoke much and in great detail
of Persepolis, and described the walls on which he
had found the inscriptions and bas-reliefs, exactly
as one would describe those of a building visited
within a few days and familiarly known. We could
not conceal our astonishment. He replied, that as
he lay in bed, all visible objects shut out, the pictures
of what he had beheld in the East continually
floated before his mind’s eye, so that it was no wonder
he could speak of them as if he had seen them
yesterday. With like vividness was the deep intense
sky of Asia, with its brilliant and twinkling
host of stars, which he had so often gazed at by
night, or its lofty vault of blue by day, reflected in
the hours of stillness and darkness on his inmost
soul; and this was his greatest enjoyment. In the
beginning of winter he had another bleeding at the
nose, so violent that the bystanders expected his
death; but this also he withstood.</p>

<p>“About the end of April, 1815, the long obstruction
in his chest grew much worse; but his friendly
physician alleviated the symptoms, which to those
around him appeared rather painful than dangerous.
Towards evening on the 26th of April, 1815, he was
read to as usual, and asked questions which showed
perfect apprehension and intelligence; he then sunk
into a slumber, and departed without a struggle.”</p>

<p>Niebuhr had attained his eighty-second year. He
was a man rather below than above the middle size,
but robust in make, and exceedingly oriental in air
and gestures. As might be clearly enough inferred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
from his works, he was no lover of poetry; for,
though he is said to have admired Homer in the
German translation of Voss, together with the Herman
and Dorothea of Goëthe, this might be accounted
for upon a different principle. His imagination, however,
was liable to be sometimes excited in a very
peculiar way. “It is extraordinary,” says his son,
“that this man, so remarkably devoid of imagination,

<h2 class="nobreak"  id="CHOISEUL-GOUFFIER">MARIE GABRIEL AUGUSTE FLORENT, LE
COMTE DE CHOISEUL-GOUFFIER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">Born 1752.&mdash;Died 1817.</p>

<p>I have frequently regretted, during the composition
of these Lives, that the materials for the early
biography of many celebrated men should be so
scanty and incomplete as I have found them. It
seems to be considered sufficient if we can obtain
some general notion respecting their literary career,
and, in consequence, criticism too frequently usurps
the place of anecdote and narrative. The Comte de
Choiseul-Gouffier occupied, however, too prominent
a place among his contemporaries, both from his
rank and talents, to allow any portion of his life to
pass unnoticed; though it were to be wished that
those who have spoken of him had been less eloquent
and more circumstantial. The style of mortuary
panegyric seems less designed, indeed, to make
known the qualities or adventures of the deceased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
than to afford the orator an apology for casting over
his memory a veil of fine language, which as effectually
conceals from the observer the real nature of
the subject as his stiff sombre pall conceals his
hearse and coffin. Such, notwithstanding, are the
only sources, besides his own works, from which a
knowledge of this celebrated and able traveller is to
be derived.</p>

<p>Choiseul-Gouffier was born at Paris in 1752. His
family was scarcely less ancient or illustrious than
that of the kings of France, in every page of whose
history, says M. Dacier, we find traces of its importance
and splendour. He pursued his youthful studies
at the College D’Harcourt. Like Swift, and many
other literary men who have acquired a high reputation
in after-life, Choiseul did not render himself
remarkable for a rapid progress or precocious abilities
at school. He was attentive to his studies,
however; and while he exhibited a decided taste for
literature, his passion for the fine arts was no less
powerful. At this period, says M. Dacier, a great
name and a large fortune had frequently no other
effect than to inspire their owners with the love of
dissipation and frivolous amusement, which they
were aware could in no degree obstruct their career
in the road to honour and office, which, however
worthless might be their characters, was opened to
them by their birth. From this general contagion
Choiseul was happily protected by his studious
habits. Every moment which he could with propriety
snatch from the duties of his station was devoted
to literature and the arts of design. Above all
things, he admired with enthusiasm whatever had
any relation to ancient Greece,&mdash;a country which,
from his earliest boyhood, he passionately desired
to behold, as the cradle of poetry, of the arts, and
of freedom, rich in historical glory, and rendered
illustrious by every form of genius which can ennoble
human nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Being in possession of a fortune which placed
within his reach the gratification of these ardent
wishes, he nevertheless did not immediately commence
his travels. In defiance of the fashion of the
times, which proscribed as unphilosophical the honest
feelings of the heart, Choiseul seems to have
fallen early in love, and at the age of nineteen was
married to the heiress of the Gouffier family, whose
name he ever afterward associated with his own.
Like all other persons of noble birth, he as a matter
of course adopted the profession of arms, and was
at once complimented with the rank of colonel,
which it was customary to bestow upon such persons
on their entrance into the service.</p>

<p>At length, after a protracted delay, which considering
his years is not to be regretted, Choiseul-Gouffier
departed for Greece in the month of March,
1776. Having enjoyed the advantages of the conversation
and instruction of Barthélemy, who had
himself profoundly studied Greece in her literary
monuments, Choiseul-Gouffier was, perhaps, as well
prepared to exercise the duties of a classical traveller
as any young man of twenty-five could be expected
to be. In aid of his own exertions he took
along with him several artists and literary men, of
whom some were distinguished for their taste or
natural abilities. He was transported to Greece on
board the <i>Atalante</i> ship of war, commanded by the
Marquis de Chabert, himself a member of the Academy
of Sciences, and appointed by the government
to construct a reduced chart of the Mediterranean.
This gentleman, who seems in some measure to
have possessed a congenial taste, engaged to transport
Choiseul-Gouffier to whatever part of Greece
he might be desirous of visiting, and to lie off the
land during such time as he should choose to employ
in his excursions and researches.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Greece, Choiseul-Gouffier commenced
at once his researches and his drawings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
He was not a mere classical traveller; his principal
object, it is true, was, as his French biographers
assert, to study the noble remains of antiquity, the
wrecks of that splendid and imperfect civilization
which had once covered the soil on which he was
now treading, with all the glory of the creative arts;
but, besides this, he had an eye for whatever was
interesting in the existing population, which, with
every thinking and feeling man, he must have regarded
as by far the most august and touching ruin
which the traveller can behold in Greece. The mere
undertaking of such an enterprise presupposes an
intense enthusiasm for antiquity. Poetry, history,
freedom, beauty, animate and inanimate, had separately
and collectively produced on his mind an impassioned
veneration for the Hellenic soil; and he
saw with equal delight the scene of a fable and the
site of a city.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the plan which he had traced out
for himself previous to leaving France, he examined
with scrupulous care all the fragments and ruins
within the scope of his researches. After touching
on the southern coast of the Morea, and sketching
the castle of Coron, with various Albanian soldiers
whom he met with on the shore, he proceeded to
the isles,&mdash;Milo, Siphanto, Naxia, Delos, where the
wrecks of antiquity and the grotesque costume and
manners of modern times exercised his elegant pencil
and pen. Those persons who have visited countries
where the ruins of former ages eclipse, as it
were, the stunted heirs of the soil, will comprehend
the difficulty of attending, amid monuments rendered
doubly sublime by decay, to the rude attempts at
architecture and the undignified circumstances which
mark the existence of a population relapsed into ignorance.
To these, however, Choiseul-Gouffier was
by no means inattentive. He sketched, and it would
seem with equal complacency, the ruins of some
venerable temple and the beautiful dark-eyed girl of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
the Ionian Islands, plaiting her tresses, or sporting
with her fat, long-haired Angola.</p>

<p>In sketching the life of this traveller, I must beware
that I am not carried away by classical recollections.
Here, where</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Not a mountain rears its head unsung,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>it might, perhaps, be pleasing to a certain variety
of minds to expatiate at leisure over the immortal
fields of fable, and the scenes of actions which man
is still proud to have performed; and if I abstain
from entering upon the subject, it is not from any
indifference to its charms, or that I want faith in its
powers to produce, if properly handled, the same
effect upon others which it has long exercised over
me. But this is not the place to indulge in themes
of this kind. Biography rejects all pictures of such
a description, and requires narrative; and accordingly
I proceed with the history of our traveller’s
labours.</p>

<p>In the course of his visits to the Grecian islands
he beheld the famous Grotto of Antiparos, so eloquently
described by Tournefort. Their opinions
respecting its wonderful construction did not, as
might very well be expected, agree; but if the botanist
exaggerated, I think the young antiquarian underrated
its richness and grandeur, probably from a
desire to check his ardent imagination, or by an ill-timed
application of his philosophy. From thence,
touching at Skyros in his way, he proceeded to Lemnos,
Mitelin, Scio, Samos, Patmos, and Rhodes, and
thence into Asia Minor. Here he commenced operations
with the ruins of Telmissus, in ancient Lycia.
He sketched the sarcophagi, the Necropolis, the
tombs, theatre, and other antiquities; and having
also drawn up an account of his researches, and a
description of the existing ruins, set off through
Caria towards the river Mæander, and Ephesus, and
Smyrna, and Troy. Throughout the whole of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
incomparably interesting route, the same lavish researches
were undertaken and conducted with vast
expense and perseverance. But on arriving upon
the plains of Troy, his exertions, everywhere enthusiastic,
appeared to be redoubled. Choiseul-Gouffier
was an impassioned admirer of Homer. No other
poet, in fact, ever possesses so firm a hold upon the
youthful mind as this ancient bard, because no one
paints so truly those boiling passions which prevail
in youth, and with which all men sympathize, until
age or some other cause damps their energy, and
makes them, as Shakspeare expresses it, “babble
of green fields,” and tranquillity, and security, and
civilization.</p>

<p>For the admirers of Homer, our traveller’s researches
in the ancient empire of Priam must possess
more than ordinary charms. Having to the
best of his ability determined the extent and limits
of the Trojan territories, he fixes the site of the city,
and traces to their sources the rivers Simois and
Scamander. He then presents the reader with views
of the most remarkable spots in the neighbourhood
of the city, which are either mentioned by Homer,
or referred to by celebrated writers of later date;
Mount Gargarus, the camp of the Greeks, the tombs
of Ilus, Achilles, and Patroclus.</p>

<p>On his return to France he laboured assiduously
at the arranging of the rich and various materials
which he had collected during his travels. An author,
and, above all, a traveller of distinguished rank,
is always secure beforehand of a flattering reception.
Choiseul-Gouffier experienced this truth. Fearful
lest their compliments should come too late, and be
paid, not to his rank, but to his merit, the members
of the Académie des Belles-Lettres, in obedience,
says M. Dacier, to the public voice, elected our traveller
a member of their body in the room of Mons.
Foncemagne in 1779, before the publication of the
“Voyage Pittoresque de la Grèce.” This splendid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
work, which was at least equal to any thing which
had been published of the kind, and in many respects
superior, was expected with impatience, and read
on its appearance with avidity. Praise, which in
France is but too lavishly bestowed upon noble authors,
was now showered down in profusion upon
our traveller. He, however, deserved high commendation.
The design of the work was in itself exceedingly
praiseworthy, and its execution, whether
we consider the literary portion or the embellishments,
highly honourable to the taste and talents of
the author. Barthélemy, in such matters a judge
inferior to none, conceived so favourable an opinion
of his accuracy, that he in many instances appealed
to his authority in his “Travels of Anacharsis.”</p>

<p>What tended still more powerfully to promote the
success of the “Voyage Pittoresque de la Grèce”
than all these praises was, the lively, elegant style
in which it is composed. Although the polished simplicity
of the preceding age had already begun to
give way before laborious struggles after strength
and originality, Choiseul-Gouffier belonged rather to
the old than the new school. His learning a profession,
which young men are rather apt to display
than to hide, was not very profound, I suspect, in
1782, when the first volume of his travels appeared;
and therefore the more credit is due to him for his
moderation in the use of it. But I am far from
thinking, with M. Dacier, that he purposely masked
his acquirements, from the fear of frightening away
the men of the world. He was not, as I have already
observed, unmindful of the modern Greeks. Convinced
that, next to the love of God, patriotism, expressed
in Scripture by the love of our neighbour, is
the best foundation of national and individual happiness,
our traveller was vehement in his exhortations
to the Greeks to recover their liberty. He even
pointed out to them the means by which this was to
be effected. He appealed to the priests, as to those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
who exercised the most powerful influence over the
popular mind, to sanctify the enterprise; and, by
associating the spirit of religion with that of liberty,
to inspire their flocks with the zeal of martyrs by
spiritual incitements or menaces.</p>

<p>In 1784 the success of the first volume of his
travels threw open to him the doors of the French
Academy, where he was elected to fill up the vacancy
occasioned by the death of D’Alembert. The circumstances
attending his reception into this celebrated
literary body were particularly flattering.
Never, according to the records of the times, had
there been collected together a more numerous or
more brilliant assembly. The discourse of the traveller
was finely conceived, and executed with ability.
The subject was, of course, determined by usage; it
was the eulogium of his predecessor. Having, according
to custom, by which all such things are regulated,
occasion to allude to the birth of D’Alembert, he executed
this delicate part of his task in a manner so
judicious and manly, that from a circumstance, in
itself unfortunate and dishonourable, he contrived to
attach additional interest to the memory of his predecessor.
“And yet,” said he, “what was this celebrated
man, whom Providence had destined to extend
the boundaries of human knowledge? You
understand me, gentlemen; and why should I hesitate
to express what I consider it honourable to
feel? Why should I, by a pusillanimous silence,
defraud his memory of that tribute which all noble
minds are fond to pay to unfortunate virtue and genius
in obscurity? What was he?&mdash;An unhappy,
parentless child, cast forth from his cradle to perish,
who owed to symptoms of approaching death and
the humanity of a public officer the advantage of
being snatched from amid that unfortunate multitude
of foundlings, who are kept alive only to remain in
eternal ignorance of their name and race!”</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that he received one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
those compliments which men of genius sometimes
pay to each other, and which, when deserved, are
among the most cherished rewards that can be
granted to distinguished abilities. Delille, whom he
had long numbered among his friends, eagerly seized
upon the opportunity which was now offered him
of expressing his admiration of his enthusiasm and
taste. He accordingly drew forth from his pocket
a splendid fragment of his poem entitled “Imagination,”
which was not published until twenty years
afterward, and read it to the academy. It related to
Greece, which Choiseul-Gouffier had visited and depicted.
He represents the forlorn genius of that
ancient country singling out from among the crowd
of ordinary travellers one young lover of the arts,
recommending to his notice the glory of her ancient
monuments and brilliant recollections, and promising
him as his reward the academic palm in a <i>New
Athens</i>. The verses, in spite of the national vanity
of comparing Paris with Athens, and some other
defects which I need not pause to point out, are
highly poetical and beautiful; and the reader will
not, I think, regret to find them here subjoined.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Choiseul-Gouffier was appointed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
ambassador of France to the Ottoman Porte, and, in
selecting the companions of his mission, was not
unmindful of Delille. The poet, therefore, accompanied
him to Constantinople; and according to the
testimony of both, many years after their return,
nothing could exceed the delight of their residence
in the East, and their visits to the spots celebrated
in Grecian story. Choiseul-Gouffier would, from all
accounts, appear to have been a man of enlarged
views, friendly towards all nations, as well as towards
every art, and anxious to promote the general
interests of civilization. His agreeable manners
enabled him quickly to acquire the confidence of
Halil Pasha, the Turkish grand vizier, and of Prince
Mauro Cordato, first dragoman of the Porte; and he
succeeded in inspiring both with a desire to introduce
among the Turks the arts and civilization of
Europe. By his advice, engineer, artillery, and staff
officers were invited from France to Constantinople,
to instruct the Ottomans in the theory and practice
of war. The impulse once given, the grand vizier,
seconded by the dragoman, who would appear to
have possessed unusual influence, repaired the fortifications
in the various strong cities of the empire,
improved the system of casting cannon, and considerably
ameliorated the discipline of the Turkish
army. Shortly the public saw with surprise a fine
seventy-four, constructed by Leroy, after the most
approved European method, launched from the docks
of Constantinople; and the system thus introduced
has ever since been followed in all the docks of the
empire. To crown all these efforts, our traveller
prevailed on the vizier to send thirty Turkish youths
to receive their education in Paris; and had not this
part of the scheme been defeated by religious fanaticism,
there is no foreseeing to how great an extent
this measure might have influenced the destinies of
Turkey.</p>

<p>When war had broken out between the Porte and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Russia, in spite of the efforts of the French ambassador
to prevent the rupture, he continued to perform
the part of a conciliator. It was by his intercession
that the Russian ambassador, imprisoned
contrary to the law of nations in the Seven Towers,
was liberated, and placed on board a French frigate,
commanded by the Prince de Rohan, which conveyed
him to Trieste. And afterward, when Austria
had determined to unite its forces with those of
Russia to attack the common enemy of Christendom,
Choiseul-Gouffier succeeded in preventing the
imprisonment of its internuncio, whom he caused
to embark with all his family and suite on board two
French ships, which conveyed them to Leghorn.
At the same time he effectually protected the Russian
and Austrian prisoners detained in chains at
Constantinople, and carefully caused to be distributed
among them the provisions which their
governments or families conveyed to them through
his means. Several of these miserable beings he
ransomed from captivity with his own money, particularly
a young Austrian officer who had fallen
into the hands of a cruel master, and who, resigned
to his unhappy condition, appeared only to grieve
for the affliction which the sad lot of their only son
would cause his aged parents. His zeal for the interests
of Turkey was not less remarkable. For
not only did he in like manner protect the Turkish
prisoners in Russia, but he caused French ships to
transport provisions to Constantinople and the Black
Sea, whose losses, when they incurred any, he made
up out of his own private fortune.</p>

<p>In the midst of those assiduous and important
cares which the policy and critical position of the
Ottoman empire required of him, he at no time lost
sight of the commerce and other interests of his
country. He moreover found leisure for the indulgence
of his old classical tastes, and once more
ran over, with the Iliad in his hand, the whole of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Troad and the other places celebrated by Homer.
In addition to this, he despatched several artists to
Syria and Egypt at his own expense, for the purpose
of exploring and sketching ancient monuments,
ruins, picturesque sites, and in general whatever
was worthy of occupying the attention of the learned
world. In 1791 he was appointed by the new government
ambassador to the court of London; but as
his political principles would not allow him to acknowledge
the authority from which this nomination
proceeded, he still continued at Constantinople,
from whence he addressed all his despatches to the
brothers of Louis XVI., then in Germany. This correspondence
was seized during the following year
by the French army in Champagne, and on the 22d
of November, 1792, a decree of arrest was passed
against him.</p>

<p>Not long after this event he departed from Constantinople,
honoured with distinguished marks of
respect both by the sultan and the grand vizier, and
sincerely regretted by his brother ambassadors, and
all the French established in the Levant. Being unable
to return to France, he retired to Russia, where
Catherine, who, as I have already had frequent occasion
to observe, was an excellent judge of men,
received him in the most flattering manner, and afforded
him the most honourable protection. Paul I.,
on his accession to the throne, distinguished him by
new favours, nominated him privy counsellor, director
of the academy of arts and of all the imperial
libraries, and also gave him many other solid proofs
of his esteem. The favour of a madman, however,
was necessarily liable to change. The Comte de
Cobentzel, with whom Choiseul-Gouffier had lived
on very intimate terms, falling into disgrace, he was
uncourtly enough to continue the connexion; which
so displeased Paul, that our traveller considered it
unsafe to remain at court, and retired. No longer
seeing his old favourite about him, the imperial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
lunatic commanded him to return, and upon his approach
remarked, in a friendly tone, “M. le Count,
there are stormy cloudy days in which it rains misunderstandings;
we have experienced one of these;
but as we are men of understanding, we have shaken
it off, and are only upon the better footing.”</p>

<p>Our traveller, who no doubt saw clearly enough
the state of the emperor’s head, and dreaded his relapse
into ill-humour, very quickly determined to
return to France; where he at length arrived in 1802,
stripped of his titles and fortune, and reduced to rely
upon his literary rank for distinction. He, however,
sought for no office or employment. All his thoughts
were now directed towards the completion of his
work on his beloved Greece, and during seven years
he laboured assiduously at this agreeable undertaking.
Other travellers had in the mean while
visited and described the same countries; his ideas
and views were regarded as antiquated; the interest
inspired by his first volume, published twenty-seven
years before, had in a great measure ceased; and,
more than all this, he himself, worn down by misfortunes,
sobered by long adversity, and somewhat
unaccustomed to the art of composition, was no
longer the same <i>naïve</i>, lively author that he had
been. He now gave himself up to geographical disquisitions,
learned dissertations, and geological remarks.
Homer himself, though still his favourite,
had undergone a transformation in his eyes. Losing
sight of the poet, the matchless painter of human
nature, he was satisfied with admiring him as an
historian and geographer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there still remained a mixture of the
old leaven in his composition. The sight of the
rose harvest near Adrianople in Thrace reawakened
all his enthusiasm, and his description of the festival
with which it closes, in which the beautiful Grecian
girls perform so elegant and classical a part, would
certainly not disgrace the pages of Theocritus or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Virgil. The completion of the third volume (or
rather the 2d part of the second) seems to have been
retarded, among other causes, by the composition
of several memoirs for the Academy of Inscriptions
and Belles-Lettres, on the Olympian Hippodrome,
on the origin of the Thracian Bosphorus, and on the
personal existence of Homer, which has been called
in question by several critics more learned than wise.</p>

<p>Before the completion of his work, however, he
was seized with an apoplectic fit, which made his
friends despair of his life. He was advised to make
trial of the waters of Aix-la-Chapelle, whither he
removed, accompanied by the Princess de Bauffremont,
his second wife. Here he died on the 22d of
June, 1817. It was now feared by all those who had
properly appreciated his labours, that the concluding
portion of his work, without which the former parts
would be comparatively valueless, might never appear;
but a publisher was at length found to undertake
the expensive and hazardous enterprise. He
purchased from the Princess de Bauffremont all the
papers, charts, drawings, engravings, and copper-plates
of her deceased husband, and with a taste,
zeal, and industry for which the arts are indebted
to him, completed the “Voyage Pittoresque de la
Grèce” in a style worthy of the commencement.
The portrait of the Comte de Choiseul, which M.
Blaise, the publisher, caused to be engraved by a
distinguished French artist, is a masterpiece of its
kind; but there still remain many splendid drawings,
and several valuable maps and charts of various parts
of Greece, which may some day, perhaps, be published
as a supplement, or in a second edition, should
it be called for by the public.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="JOHN_LEWIS_BURCKHARDT">JOHN LEWIS BURCKHARDT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">Born 1784.&mdash;Died 1817.</p>

<p>This traveller, descended from an eminent family
of Basle, in Switzerland, was born at Lausanne, in
1784. He was the eighth child of John Rodolph
Burckhardt, whose prospects in life were early
blighted by his adherence to the Austrian faction
during the troubles in Switzerland, consequent upon
the French revolution. Our traveller, led by hereditary
prejudices to nourish an aversion for republican
principles, or too young and hot-headed not to
confound the agents with the cause, imbibed at a
very early age a detestation for the French, at that
period regarded as the representatives of republicanism;
and, with the same spirit which induced Pietro
della Valle to engage in a crusade against the Turks,
he wished to serve in the armies of some nation at
war with France. These wishes, however, were
the mere hallucinations of a boy, or an echo of the
sentiments which he heard uttered by others. His
education had not been completed: his notions were
necessarily crude, and he had neither discovered nor
learned from others the paramount importance of
freedom, without which even national independence
is a vain possession.</p>

<p>Burckhardt’s studies were, from various causes,
conducted in the manner best calculated to create
and nourish restless and adventurous habits. Having
received the first rudiments of his education in his
father’s house, he was removed to a school at Neufchatel,
where he remained two years. At the age of
sixteen he was entered a student at the university of
Leipzig; from whence, after four years’ residence, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
proceeded to Göttingen, where he continued another
year. He then returned to his parents. The natural
firmness and consistency of his character, of which
his countenance was strikingly expressive, still
taught him to keep alive his hatred of the French;
but no continental nation had preserved itself wholly
free from the influence of this people; and therefore,
rejecting an offer which was made him by one
of the petty courts of Germany, desirous of numbering
him among its diplomatic body, he turned his
thoughts towards England, which, like a separate
world, had remained inviolate from the tread of the
enemy. Accordingly, having provided himself with
letters of introduction to several persons of distinction,
among which was one from Professor Blumenbach
to Sir Joseph Banks, he set out for London,
where he arrived in the month of July, 1806.</p>

<p>This step was the pivot upon which the whole
circle of his short life was destined to turn. His introduction
to Sir Joseph Banks, who had long been
an active member of the African Association, almost
necessarily brought him into contact with several
other individuals connected with that celebrated society;
and conversations with these persons, whose
motives were at least respectable, and whose enthusiasm
was unbounded, naturally begot in Burckhardt
a corresponding warmth, and transformed him, from
a Quixotic crusader against the French, into an ardent,
ambitious traveller.</p>

<p>It should not be dissembled that, upon Burckhardt’s
desire to travel for the African Association
being communicated to Sir Joseph Banks and Dr.
Hamilton (then acting secretary to that body), strong
representations of the dangers to be encountered in
the execution of the plan were made to the youthful
aspirant after fame; but such representations, which
are a delusive kind of peace-offering placed for form’s
sake on the altar of conscience, are seldom sincerely
designed to effect their apparent purpose;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
and the actors in the farce would, for the most part,
experience extreme chagrin should they find their
eloquence prove successful. At all events, few men
are so ignorant as not to know that the aspect of
danger wears a certain charm for youth, which naturally
associates therewith an idea of honour; and,
provided success be probable, or even possible,
reckons obstacles of every kind among the incentives
to exertion. These dissuasive speeches, therefore,
from persons whose sole object in constituting
themselves into a public body was to produce a directly
opposite result, were altogether hypocritical;
and Burckhardt, if he possessed half the sagacity
which seems to have entered into his character, must
have distinctly perceived this, and have despised
them accordingly.</p>

<p>However this may be, his offer, which was laid
before the association at the general meeting of May,
1808, was “willingly accepted;” and he immediately
commenced all those preparations which were necessary
to the proper accomplishment of his undertaking.
He employed himself diligently in the study
of the Arabic language both in London and Cambridge,
as well as in the acquiring of a knowledge
of several branches of science, such as chymistry,
astronomy, mineralogy, medicine, and surgery; he
likewise allowed his beard to grow, assumed the
oriental dress, “and in the intervals of his studies
he exercised himself by long journeys on foot, bare-headed,
in the heat of the sun, sleeping upon the
ground, and living upon vegetables and water.”</p>

<p>On the 25th of January, 1809, he received his instructions,
by which he was directed to proceed in
the first instance to Syria, where, it was supposed,
he might complete his knowledge of the Arabic, and
acquire oriental habits and manners at a distance
from the scene of his researches, and where he was
not likely to meet with any individuals who might
afterward recognise him at an inconvenient moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Burckhardt sailed from Cowes on the 2d of March,
1809, in a merchant-ship, proceeding to the Mediterranean,
and arrived at Malta in the middle of April.
From thence, in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, he
transmitted an account of the attempt to explore the
interior of Africa which was at that time meditated
by Dr. Seetzen, a German physician, who shortly
afterward perished, not without suspicions of poison,
in Yemen; and of a recent eruption of Mount Etna,
the description of which he obtained from the letter
of an English gentleman.</p>

<p>During his stay at Malta he completed his equipment
in the oriental manner, and assumed the character
of an Indian Mohammedan merchant, bearing
despatches from the East India Company to Mr.
Barker, British consul, and the company’s agent at
Aleppo. Meanwhile he carefully avoided all intercourse
with such persons from Barbary as happened
to be in the island; and when he met parties of them
in the street, as he often did, the <i>salaam alaikum</i>,
given and returned, was all that passed between
them. There was at this time a Swiss regiment in
the English service at Malta, to many of the officers
of which Burckhardt was personally known. To
be recognised by these gentlemen would at once
have proved fatal to his assumed character; he
therefore appeared in public cautiously, and but seldom;
but had at length the satisfaction of finding
that his disguise was so complete as to enable him
to pass unknown and unnoticed.</p>

<p>Our traveller here entered into arrangements with
a Greek, respecting his passage from this island to
Cyprus; but on the very morning of his expected
departure he received information that the owner
of the ship had directed the captain to proceed to
Tripoly. His baggage was in consequence transferred
to another ship, said to be bound for the same
island; “but the very moment I was embarking,”
says Burckhardt, “the new captain told me that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
was not quite sure whether he should touch at Cyprus,
his ship being properly bound for Acre. I had
now the option to wait at Malta, perhaps another
month or two, for an opportunity for Cyprus or the
coast of Syria, or to run the chance of disembarking
at a place where there was no person whatever
to whom I could apply for advice or protection.
Luckily an Arab of Acre, then at Malta, happened
to be known to Mr. Barker, jun.; in half an hour’s
time a letter for a merchant at Acre, with another
in case of need for the pasha, were procured, and I
embarked and sailed the same morning, in the hope
of finding, when arrived at Acre, a passage for Tripoly
(Syria), or for Latakia. However, we were no
sooner out of sight of the island, than it was made
known to me that the real destination of the ship
was the coast of Caramania, that the captain had
orders to touch first at the port of Satalia, then at
that of Tarsus; and that if grain could not be purchased
at an advantageous price at either of these
places, in that case only he was to proceed to Acre.
My remonstrances with the captain would have been
vain: nothing was left to me but to cultivate his
good graces and those of my fellow-travellers, as
the progress of my journey must depend greatly
upon their good offices. The passengers consisted,
to my astonishment, of a rich Tripoline merchant,
who owned part of the ship, two other Tripolines,
and two negro slaves. I introduced myself among
them as an Indian Mohammedan merchant, who had
been from early years in England, and was now on
his way home; and I had the good fortune to make
my story credible enough to the passengers as well
as to the ship’s company. During the course of our
voyage numerous questions were put to me relative
to India, its inhabitants, and its language, which I
answered as well as I could: whenever I was asked
for a specimen of the Hindoo language, I answered
in the worst dialect of the Swiss German, almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
unintelligible even to a German, and which in its
guttural sounds may fairly rival the harshest utterance
of Arabic. Every evening we assembled upon
deck to enjoy the cooling sea-breeze and to smoke
our pipes. While one of the sailors was amusing
his companions with story-telling, I was called upon
to relate to my companions the wonders of the
farthest east; of the grand mogul, and the riches of
his court; of the widows in Hindostan burning
themselves; of the Chinese, their wall, and great
porcelain tower,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>They sailed along the southern coast of Candia,
saw Rhodes at a great distance, and arrived in a few
days at Satalia in Caramania. Here the plague, it
was found, was raging in the town; but this circumstance
did not prevent the Tripoline merchant from
landing and disposing of his merchandise, nor the
captain from receiving him again on board. When
their business with this town was completed, they
again set sail, and after coasting for three days along
the shore of Caramania, arrived in the roads of
Mersin, from whence Burckhardt and several of his
companions proceeded by land on an excursion to
Tarsus. Finding here a ship bound for the coast
of Syria, our traveller left the Maltese vessel in order
to proceed by this new conveyance: “In taking
leave of the Tripoline,” says he, “I took off my
sash, a sort of red cambric shawl, of Glasgow manufacture,
which he had always much admired, thinking
it to be Indian stuff, and presented it to him as
a keepsake or reward for his good services. He immediately
unloosened his turban, and twisted the
shawl in its stead round his head: making me many
professions of friendship, and assuring me of his
hospitality, if ever the chance of mercantile pursuits
should again engage me to visit the Mediterranean,
and perhaps Tripoly in Barbary.”</p>

<p>Burckhardt reached the coast of Syria at that
point where the Aasi, the ancient Orontis, falls into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the sea; and immediately prepared to depart for
Aleppo with a caravan. Having been intrusted with
several chests for the British consul at Aleppo, his
baggage appeared considerable; and he was consequently
sent for by the aga, who expected a handsome
present for permitting them to pass. When
questioned by this officer respecting the contents of
the chests, he replied that he was entirely ignorant
of the matter, but suspected that among other things
there was a sort of French drink, called <i>beer</i>, with
various kinds of eatables. The aga now sent an
officer to examine them. A bottle of beer having
been broken in loading, “the man tasted it by putting
his finger into the liquor, and found it abominably
bitter: such was his report to the aga. As a
sample of the eatables, he produced a potato which
he had taken out of one of the barrels, and that
noble root excited general laughter in the room: ‘It
is well worth while,’ they said, ‘to send such stuff
to such a distance.’ The aga tasted of the raw potato,
and spitting it out again, swore at the Frank’s
stomach which could bear such food.” The mean
opinion which these specimens inspired them with
for such merchandise inclined the aga to be content
with the trifling sum of ten piastres, which he probably
thought more than the value of a whole ship’s
cargo of potatoes and beer.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the caravan at Antakia, our
traveller, desirous of studying the manners of all
ranks of men, took up his quarters in the khan of
the muleteers, where, from a suspicion that he was
a Frank in disguise, he was subjected to numerous
indignities. The aga’s dragoman, some wretched
Frenchman or Piedmontese, being sent by his master
to discover the truth, and failing to effect his purpose
by any other means, determined, as a last resource,
on pulling him by the beard, and at the same
time asked him familiarly why he had suffered such
a thing to grow? To this Burckhardt replied by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
striking him on the face, which turned the laugh
against the poor dragoman, and was an argument so
peculiarly Mohammedan that it seems to have convinced
the bystanders of the truth of his assertions.</p>

<p>After a delay of four days he continued his journey
with the caravan, with the motley members of
which he was compelled to maintain an unceasing
struggle in defence of his assumed character; a circumstance
which proves one of two things, either
that the Saonees of the west have by intercourse
with Europeans been rendered more acute in discovering
impostors, than the Shiahs of Afghanistan
and Northern Persia, or that Burckhardt was hitherto
somewhat unskilful in his movements; for the
reader will no doubt remember that Forster, when
he professed Mohammedanism, had much fewer
suspicions to combat on his way through Central
Asia.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Aleppo, he determined, in pursuance
of the advice of Mr. Barker, to put off his Mohammedan
disguise, though he still retained the
Turkish dress; and with the aid of an able master,
recommenced the study of the Arabic, both literal
and vulgar. He was attacked, however, shortly
after his arrival, by a strong inflammatory fever,
which lasted a fortnight; and was occasioned, as he
conjectured, by the want of sleep, of which blessing
he had been deprived by the prodigious colonies
of that “friendly beast to man” which, according
to Sir Hugh Evans, “signifies love,” which had established
themselves in his garments during his stay
at the khan of Antakia. When this seasoning was
over, his health appeared to be improved, and he
found the climate finer and more salubrious than he
had expected.</p>

<p>During his stay in this city, which was a very
protracted one, Burckhardt laboured assiduously in
fitting himself for the honourable performance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
the task he had undertaken. His Arabic studies
were uninterrupted. Besides seizing eagerly on
every opportunity of improving himself by conversation
with the natives, he laboured at an attempt
to transform “Robinson Crusoe” into an Arabian
tale. He moreover succeeded in making the acquaintance
of several sheïkhs, and other literary
men, who honoured him occasionally with a visit;
a favour, he says, which he owed principally to Mr.
Wilkins’s “Arabic and Persian Dictionary.” The
ordinary lexicons of the country being very defective,
the learned Turks were often obliged to have
recourse to Wilkins, whose learning and exactness
sometimes compelled them to exclaim, “How wonderful
that a Frank should know more of our language
than our first ulmas!”</p>

<p>In the month of July, 1810, Burckhardt departed
from Aleppo under the protection of an Arab sheïkh,
of the Aenezy tribe, who undertook to escort him
to Palmyra, and thence through the Haurān to Damascus.
On the way they were attacked, while the
sheïkh was absent at a watering-place, by the hostile
Marváli Arabs, by whom our traveller was
robbed of his watch and compass; after which he
pushed on into the desert to rejoin the chief. Contrary
to the well-known faith of the Arabs, this man
transferred to another the protection of his guest,
thereby exposing him to be robbed a second time, at
Palmyra, where the bandit in authority, finding that
he had no money, contented himself with seizing
upon his saddle. Returning from these ruins, he
found at Yerud a letter from the sheïkh, forbidding
him to proceed towards the Haurān, because, as
the writer asserted, the invasion of the Wahabis had
rendered that portion of the country unsafe, even
to himself and his Arabs. In consequence of this
fraudulent conduct of the sheïkh, for the excuse was
a fiction, he found himself necessitated to take the
road to Damascus; disappointed in part, but upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
the whole well satisfied with having beheld those
magnificent ruins in the desert which have charmed
so many strangers, and with having at the same
time enjoyed so many occasions of observing the
Bedouins under their own tents, where he was everywhere
received with hospitality and kindness.</p>

<p>The rich and well-cultivated environs of Damascus,
which all travellers, from Mohammed to the
present day, have admired, appeared to great advantage
to the eye of Burckhardt, accustomed to be
sickened by the signs of misery which surround
Aleppo. “The unsettled state of the government
of Damascus,” says he, “obliged me to prolong my
stay there for upwards of six weeks. I again left
it in the middle of September, to visit Baalbec and
Libanus. My route lay through Zahle, a small but
prosperous town on the western side of the valley
Bekan, the ancient Cœlosyria, and from thence to
Baalbec, where I remained three days; then to the
top of the Libanus, the Cedars, and Kannobin, from
whence, following the highest summits of the mountain,
I returned to Zahle by the villages called
Akoura and Afki.”</p>

<p>After proceeding southward to the territory of the
Druses, and Mount Hermon, he returned to Damascus;
whence, after a short stay, he made an excursion
into the Haurān, the patrimony of Abraham,
which four years before had been in part visited by
Dr. Seetzen, previous to his tour round the Dead
Sea. “During a fatiguing journey of twenty-six
days,” says Burckhardt, “I explored this country as
far as five days’ journey to the south and south-east
of Damascus; I went over the whole of the Jebel
Haurān, or mountain of the Druses, who have in
these parts a settlement of about twenty villages;
I passed Bozra, a place mentioned in the books of
Moses, and not to be confounded with Boostra; I
then entered the desert to the south-east of it, and
returned afterward to Damascus through the rocky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
district on the foot of the Jebel Haurān, called El
Leja. At every step I found vestiges of ancient
cities; saw the remains of many temples, public
edifices, and Greek churches; met at Shohbe with
a well-preserved amphitheatre, at other places with
numbers of still standing columns, and had opportunities
of copying many Greek inscriptions, which
may serve to throw some light upon the history of
this almost forgotten corner. The inscriptions are
for the greater part of the lower empire, but some
of the most elegant ruins have their inscriptions
dated from the reigns of Trajan and M. Aurelius.
The Haurān, with its adjacent districts, is the spring
and summer rendezvous of most of the Arab tribes,
who inhabit in winter time the great Syrian desert,
called by them El Hammad. They approach the
cultivated lands in search of grass, water, and corn,
of which last they buy up in the Haurān their
yearly provision.”</p>

<p>Having to a certain extent satisfied his curiosity
respecting this obscure country, he returned by way
of Homs and Hamah towards Aleppo, where he arrived
on the New-year’s day of 1811. He now
meditated an excursion into the desert towards the
Euphrates, but was for some time prevented from
putting his design in execution by the troubled state
of the country, two powerful Arab tribes, the one
inimical, the other friendly to the Aleppines, having
been for many months at war with each other.
Burckhardt at length succeeded, however, in placing
himself under the protection of the Sheïkh of Sukhne,
and set out towards the desert: but his own account
of this journey was lost, and all that can now be
known of it is to be gathered from a letter from
Mr. Barker, the celebrated British consul at Aleppo,
to whose princely hospitality so many travellers of
all nations have been indebted. “One hundred and
twenty, or one hundred and fifty miles below the
ruins of Membigeh, in the Zor,” says this gentleman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
“there is a tract on the banks of the Euphrates
possessed by a tribe of very savage Arabs.
Not far from them is the village of Sukhne, at the
distance of five days from Aleppo, and of twelve
hours from Palmyra, in the road which Zenobia in
her flight took to gain the Euphrates. The people
of Sukhne are sedentary Arabs, of a breed half
Fellah and half Bedouin. They bring to Aleppo
alkali and ostrich feathers. It was upon one of
these visits of the Sheïkh of Sukhne to Aleppo, that
Burckhardt, after some negotiation, resolved to accept
the protection of the sheïkh, who undertook,
upon their arrival at his village, to place him under
the protection of a Bedouin of sufficient influence
to procure him a safe passage through the tribes of
the country which he wished to explore. Burckhardt
had reason to be satisfied both with the Sheïkh
of Sukhne, and with the Arab whom he procured as
an escort, except that, in the end, the protection of
the latter proved insufficient. The consequence
was, that poor Burckhardt was stripped to the skin,
and he returned to Sukhne, his body blistered with
the rays of the sun, and without having accomplished
any of the objects of his journey. It was in this
excursion to the desert that Burckhardt had so hard
a struggle with an Arab lady, who took a fancy to
the only garment which the delicacy or compassion
of the men had left him.”</p>

<p>After his return from this unfortunate journey,
Burckhardt was delayed for a considerable time at
Aleppo by incessant rains; but at length, on the
14th of February, he bade this city a final adieu,
and hastened once more to Damascus. He was desirous,
before quitting Syria, of performing another
journey in the Haurān. This he completed, and
having transmitted to England an account of his
discoveries in this extraordinary region, he departed
on the 18th of June for the Dead Sea. The
reader will not, I imagine, be displeased to find the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
description of this journey given in the author’s own
words: having reached Nazareth, “I met here,”
says he, “a couple of petty merchants from Szalt,
a castle in the mountains of Balka, which I had not
been able to see during my late tour, and which lies
on the road I had pointed out to myself for passing
into the Egyptian deserts. I joined their caravan;
after eight hours’ march, we descended into the valley
of the Jordan, called El Gor, near Bysan;
crossed the river, and continued along its verdant
banks for about ten hours, until we reached the river
Zerka, near the place where it empties itself into
the Jordan. Turning then to our left, we ascended
the eastern chain, formerly part of the district of
Balka, and arrived at Szalt, two long days’ journey
from Nazareth. The inhabitants of Szalt are entirely
independent of the Turkish government; they
cultivate the ground for a considerable distance
round their habitations, and part of them live the
whole year round in tents, to watch their harvests
and to pasture their cattle. Many ruined places and
mountains in the district of Balka preserve the
names of the Old Testament, and elucidate the topography
of the province that fell to the share of the
tribes of Gad and Reuben. Szalt is at present the
only inhabited place in the Balka, but numerous
Arab tribes pasture there their camels and sheep.
I visited from thence the ruins of Amān, or Philadelphia,
five hours and a half distant from Szalt.
They are situated in a valley on both sides of a
rivulet, which empties itself into the Zerka. A
large amphitheatre is the most remarkable of these
ruins, which are much decayed, and in every respect
inferior to those of Jerash. At four or five
hours south-east of Amān are the ruins of Om
Erresas and El Kotif, which I could not see, but
which, according to report, are more considerable
than those of Philadelphia. The want of communication
between Szalt and the southern countries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
delayed my departure for upwards of a week; I
found at last a guide, and we reached Kerek in two
days and a half, after having passed the deep beds
of the torrents El Wale and El Mojeb, which I suppose
to be the Nahaliel and Arnon. The Mojeb divides
the district of Balka from that of Kerek, as it
formerly divided the Moabites from the Amorites.
The ruins of Eleale, Hesebon, Meon, Medaba, Dibon,
Arver, all situated on the north side of the Arnon,
still subsist to illustrate the history of the Beni
Israel. To the south of the wild torrent Mojeb I
found the considerable ruins of Rabbab Moab: and,
three hours’ distance from them, the town of Kerek,
situated at about twelve hours’ distance to the east
of the southern extremity of the Dead Sea....</p>

<p>“The treachery of the Sheïkh of Kerek, to whom
I had been particularly recommended by a grandee
of Damascus, obliged me to stay at Kerek above
twenty days. After having annoyed me in different
ways, he permitted me to accompany him southward,
as he had himself business in the mountains
of Djebal, a district which is divided from that of
Kerek by the deep bed of the torrent El Ahhsa, or
El Kahary, eight hours’ distance from Kerek. We
remained for ten days in the villages to the north
and south of El Ansa, which are inhabited by Arabs,
who have become cultivators, and who sell the produce
of their fields to the Bedouins. The sheïkh,
having finished his business, left me at Beszeyra, a
village about sixteen hours south of Kerek, to shift
for myself, after having maliciously recommended
me to the care of a Bedouin, with whose character
he must have been acquainted, and who nearly
stripped me of the remainder of my money. I encountered
here many difficulties, was obliged to walk
from one encampment to another, until I found at
last a Bedouin who engaged to carry me to Egypt.
In his company I continued southward, in the mountains of
Shera, which are divided to the north from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Djebal by the broad valley called Ghoseyr, at about
five hours’ distance from Beszeyra. The chief place
in Djebal is Tafyle, and in Shera the castle of Shobak.
This chain of mountains is a continuation of the
eastern Syrian chain, which begins with the Antilibanus,
joins the Jebel el Sheïkh, forms the valley
of Ghor, and borders the Dead Sea. The valley of
Ghor is continued to the south of the Dead Sea;
at about sixteen hours’ distance from the extremity
of the Dead Sea its name is changed into that of
Araba, and it runs in almost a straight line, declining
somewhat to the west as far as Akaba, at the
extremity of the eastern branch of the Red Sea.
The existence of this valley appears to have been
unknown to ancient as well as modern geographers,
although it is a very remarkable feature in the geography
of Syria and Arabia Petræa, and is still more
interesting for its productions. In this valley the
manna is still found; it drops from the sprigs of
several trees, but principally from the Gharrab. It
is collected by the Arabs, who make cakes of it,
and who eat it with butter; they call it Assal Beyrook,
or the honey of Beyrook. Indigo, gum-arabic,
and the silk-tree, called Asheyr, whose fruit encloses
a white silky substance, of which the Arabs twist
their matches, grow in this valley.”</p>

<p>In this valley, about two long days’ journey north-east
of Akaba, is a small rivulet, near the banks of
which Burckhardt discovered the ruins of a city,
which he conjectured to be those of Petra, the
capital of Arabia Petræa. No other European traveller
had ever visited the spot, though few places in
Western Asia seem more curious or deserving of
examination. The red rocks composing the flanks
of the valley contained upwards of two hundred
and fifty sepulchral chambers, adorned with Grecian
ornaments. Besides these there were numerous
mausolea, some in the Egyptian style, with obelisks,
others in the chaste manner of the Greeks; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
among the latter there was one in perfect preservation,
and of vast dimensions, with all its apartments,
its vestibule, its peristyle, &amp;c. cut out in the solid
rock. On the summit of the mountain which forms
the western boundary of the valley is the tomb of
Aaron, which the Arabs, who are great Scriptural
antiquarians, hold in extraordinary veneration. Our
traveller, however, to his great regret, was necessitated
to abandon to some more fortunate visiter the
thorough examination of this interesting region, at
which circumstances allowed him merely to cast a
glance as he was hurrying along with his Bedouin
conductor towards the Red Sea. In proceeding
from this place towards Akaba he encountered a
small party of Arabs who were conducting a few
camels for sale to Cairo, and uniting himself to this
little caravan, performed the remainder of the journey
in their company. “We crossed the valley of
Araba,” says he, “ascended on the other side of it
the barren mountains of Beyane, and entered the
desert called El Tih, which is the most barren and
horrid tract of country I have ever seen; black
flints cover the chalky or sandy ground, which in
most places is without any vegetation. The tree
which produces the gum-arabic grows in some spots;
and the tamarisk is met with here and there; but
the scarcity of water forbids much extent of vegetation,
and the hungry camels are obliged to go in the
evening for whole hours out of the road in order to
find some withered shrubs upon which to feed.
During ten days’ forced marches we passed only four
springs or wells, of which one only, at about eight
hours east of Suez, was of sweet water. The others
were brackish and sulphureous. We passed at a
short distance to the north of Suez, and arrived at
Cairo by the pilgrim road.”</p>

<p>On his arrival at Cairo, Burckhardt’s first employment
was to draw up a detailed account of his journey
through Arabia Petræa: he then turned his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
attention to the means of fulfilling the great design
of his mission; but no opportunity of penetrating
into the interior of Africa occurring, he undertook,
in order to fill up the interval thus created, a journey
into Nubia. During his residence at Cairo, and on
his journey up the Nile to Assouan, he beheld the
principal ruins of Egypt. His preparations for the
Nubian excursion were soon made. He purchased
two dromedaries, one for himself and the other for
his guide, for about twenty-two pounds; provided
himself with letters of recommendation, and a firman
from the pasha; and leaving his servant and baggage
at Assouan, set out with his guide on the 14th of
February, 1813, carrying along with him nothing but
a gun, a sabre, a pistol, a provision-bag, and a
woollen mantle, which served by day for a carpet,
and for a covering during the night.</p>

<p>Their road lay along the eastern bank of the Nile;
they passed Philæ (where, a few days before, a pregnant
woman had been killed in a fray, as the softer
sex always mix in the battles in which their husbands
are engaged, which had created a deadly feud
between the hostile villages); and then pushed on
with rapidity towards Derr. The Mameluke chiefs,
with their desperate followers, were at this period
roaming about Nubia, amusing their imaginations
with vain projects for the recovery of Egypt.&mdash;Every
person coming from the north was of course
an object of curiosity, if not of suspicion, to these
baffled soldiers, as it was possible he might be the
bearer of tidings of events upon the results of which
their fate depended. Such was the state of things
when Burckhardt entered Nubia. Everywhere reports
calculated to create alarm were circulated.
To-day it was said that the Mamelukes had descended,
like famished tigers, from the mountains,
and were about to deliver up the whole country to
plunder and devastation; to-morrow they appeared
to have passed away, like a thunder-cloud, towards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Dongola and the desert, leaving behind them that
sort of uneasy satisfaction with which we behold
the quelling of unruly elements.</p>

<p>Burckhardt arrived at Derr on the 1st of March,
and, to his surprise, found two Mameluke beys at
the palace of the governor. He had reckoned upon
their utter disappearance, and had intended, under
these circumstances, to represent himself as the
secret agent of the Pasha of Egypt; but learning,
upon inquiry, that the pasha and his enemies were
regarded with nearly equal dread by the Nubian
princes, he changed his resolution, and professed to
be guided in his motions by no other motive than
pleasure. Ignorant persons find it hard to conceive
that men can expose themselves to difficulties and
dangers from an enthusiasm for knowledge, or can
find pleasure in encountering hardships and fatigue;
however, a concurrence of fortunate circumstances
extorted from the governor a permission to proceed,
and accordingly, having provided himself with provisions
for the road, our traveller departed for
Sukkot.</p>

<p>His guide on the present occasion was an old
Arab of the Ababde tribe. The branch of the Ababde
to which this man, whose name was Mohammed,
belonged, feed their flocks on the uninhabited banks
of the river, and on its numerous islands, as far
south as Dongola. Though poor, they refuse to
bestow their daughters, who are famed for their
beauty, in marriage on the rich Nubians, and have
thus preserved the purity of their race. They are,
moreover, an honest and hospitable race, and during
his journeys in Nubia, Burckhardt was constantly
received and treated with kindness by these simple
people.</p>

<p>In pursuing his course up the Nile, our traveller
passed a day at Ibrim, a town inhabited by Turks,
where, though quarrels and bloodshed were frequent,
property was more secure than in any other town
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
he had visited in the eastern world; the corn was
left all night in the field, and the cattle on the banks
of the river, unwatched, and even the greater part
of the household furniture remained all night under
the palm-trees around their dwellings. Indeed, theft
was here quite unknown. Proceeding a short distance
to the south of this town, he dismounted from
his dromedary, and directing his guide to continue his
road to the next village, struck off into a narrow
footpath along the lofty, precipitous shores of the
river. Pursuing this mountain-track he arrived at
an ancient temple hewn out of the rock, in as perfect
a state of preservation as when first finished. Sepulchral
chambers and mystic sculptures, the usual
accompaniments of Egyptian temples, were found
here.</p>

<p>The reception which our traveller and his guide
met with at the Nubian villages was generally hospitable;
as soon as they alighted a mat was spread
for them upon the ground, just before the door of
the house, which none but intimate friends are permitted
to enter; dhourra bread, milk, and sometimes
dates were placed before the strangers, and
their host, if earnestly pressed, sat down with them.
Straw, when plentiful, was likewise given to their
camels; and when the host desired to be particularly
hospitable, a breakfast of hot milk and bread was
served up before their departure in the morning.</p>

<p>At length, on the 6th of March, they arrived on a
sandy plain, sprinkled with rocky points, which
thrust up their heads through the sand that concealed
their bases. Here they encamped in the evening
near one of the islands which are formed by the
river. The noise of the cataract was heard in the
night, at about half an hour’s distance. The place
is very romantic: when the inundation subsides,
many small lakes are left among the rocks; and the
banks of these, overgrown with large tamarisks,
have a picturesque appearance amid the black and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
green rocks; the lakes and pools thus formed cover
a space of upwards of two miles in breadth.</p>

<p>The Arabs who serve as guides through these
wild districts “have devised,” says Burckhardt, “a
singular mode of extorting small presents from the
traveller: they alight at certain spots, and beg a
present; if it is refused, they collect a heap of sand,
and mould it into the form of a diminutive tomb, and
then placing a stone at each of its extremities, they
apprize the traveller that his tomb is made; meaning
that henceforward there will be no security for him
in this rocky wilderness. Most persons pay a trifling
contribution rather than have their graves made
before their eyes; there were, however, several
tombs of this description dispersed over the plain.
Being satisfied with my guide, I gave him one piastre,
with which he was content.”</p>

<p>On his arriving in the territory of Sukkot, he presented
the letter to the governor of which he was
the bearer; and received from this old savage a scrap
of paper, containing an introduction to his son, who
was the chief of the southern part of the district.
Here the guide, who had been granted him at Derr,
reached the extremity of his commission, and announced
his intention of returning from thence;
four piastres, however, overcame his determination,
and he agreed to proceed to Mahass: “If Hassan
Kashif,” said he, “upbraids me, I shall tell him that
you rode on, notwithstanding my exhortations, and
that I did not think it honourable to leave you alone.”
An admirable custom prevails in this and every other
part of Nubia: water-jars are placed under a low
roof at short distances by the roadside, where the
traveller may always quench his thirst; and every
village pays a small monthly sum to some person to
fill those jars morning and evening. The same
thing is practised upon a much larger scale in Upper
Egypt.</p>

<p>Upon Burckhardt’s reaching the Mahass territory,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
he suddenly found himself in the midst of the worst
description of savages. The governor, a ferocious
black, received him in a hut, furiously intoxicated,
and surrounded by numerous followers in the same
condition. In the midst of their drunken mirth they
called for their muskets, and amused themselves
with firing in the hut. Burckhardt every moment
expected that a random ball would put an end to his
travels; but the palm wine at length extended the
whole of this atrocious rabble upon the ground, and
next morning, when sleep had somewhat restored
the tone of the governor’s senses, he found time to
question our traveller respecting the motives of his
visit. The story which he related to them was not
believed: “You are an agent of Mohammed,” said
they; “but at Mahass we spit at Mohammed Ali’s
beard, and cut off the heads of those who are
enemies to the Mamelukes.” These suspicions,
although they produced no immediate injury to his
personal safety, entirely put a stop to his progress
farther south; for he was now within two days and
a half of the limits of Dongola, where the Mamelukes
were lords paramount, and to enter their territories
with the character of an agent of Mohammed
Ali would be to court certain death. He therefore
turned his face towards the north, and travelled with
all possible celerity along the eastern bank of the
Nile, until he arrived at Kolbe, where he swam across
the river, holding by his camel’s tail with one hand,
and urging on the beast with the other.</p>

<p>Burckhardt now descended the Nile to Ipsambol,
the vast rocky temple of which he supposed to be
of extremely ancient date. He here found four
colossal statues of enormous magnitude, which had
been hewn out of the rock, on the face of an elevated
cliff, with their backs adhering to the precipice.
The fine sand of the desert had been blown
up into mounds against the rock, and covered two
of these statues almost entirely; the rest rose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
somewhat above the surface. The faces of these
colossal statues are turned towards the north.
“The head, which is above the surface,” says he,
“has a most expressive youthful countenance, approaching
nearer to the Grecian model of beauty
than that of any ancient Egyptian figure I have seen;
indeed, were it not for a thin, oblong beard, it might
well pass for a head of Pallas.”</p>

<p>From Ipsambol he continued his journey to Mosmos
and Derr, where he parted with his guide, who,
on taking his leave, begged as a present the mellaye,
or cloak, which our traveller usually wore. To this
request Burckhardt replied, “May God smooth your
path!”&mdash;a phrase usually addressed to beggars, when
they are civilly told to be gone. “No,” said the
Arab, who had often employed this phrase when he
desired to elude the questions of the traveller, “for
once I will beg you to smooth it.” “So,” says
Burckhardt, “I gave him the mellaye, and a small
present in money; and am confident that Abou Saad
will never forget me.”</p>

<p>On his return to Assouan, Burckhardt’s first care
was to repair, by repose, the inroads which fatigue
had made upon his constitution. He then repaired
to Esne, where he established his head-quarters. It
being his policy to excite but little attention, he
very seldom went into company, dressed meanly,
and reduced his expenditure to the lowest possible
sum. The cheapness of provisions was incredible.
His whole expenditure for himself, his servant, his
dromedary, and his ass not exceeding one shilling
and sixpence per day, while his horse cost him no
more than sixteen pence per month.</p>

<p>Here he remained until the 2d of March, 1814,
when he joined himself, as a petty trader, to another
caravan, which was proceeding from Deraou to Berber.
The caravan, consisting of about fifty merchants,
with their slaves and beasts, moved under
the protection of about thirty Ababde Arabs, who,
though no heroes or philosophers, were not remarkably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
deficient either in courage or humanity.
Burckhardt was a man more apt to blame than
praise. If an individual performed a generous action,
he generally evinced a disposition to attribute
it to some selfish or mean motive, probably from the
opinion that it might be considered vulgar and unphilosophical
to betray a belief in disinterested
virtue. It is to be regretted, however, that he
should have indulged in this unamiable habit of thinking,
as nothing more surely tends to awaken the resentment
or suspicion of the reader, who will be led
to imagine that he who constantly misrepresents the
motives of men may sometimes, from unknown
causes, be tempted to misrepresent their manners
and actions also. If we do not entertain this opinion
of Burckhardt, it is that we exercise towards him a
higher degree of charity than he was accustomed to
exercise towards others.</p>

<p>The march of a caravan through the desert is a
magnificent spectacle. There is a kind of sublime
daring in thus venturing upon what seem to be the
secret places of nature; the places whence the simoom,
the hurricane, and the locust-cloud issue forth
upon their fatal errands, and where many tremendous
phenomena, peculiar to those dreary regions, present
themselves, at intervals, to the astonished but
delighted eye of the traveller.</p>

<p>Burckhardt, on this occasion, possessed no command
over his own movements. He travelled,
halted, ate, slept, in obedience to the fantasy of the
caravan-leaders; who were ignorant, however, that
the humble trader, whom they regarded, at most,
with compassion, was at that moment forming reflections,
and bringing observations to maturity,
which were, perhaps for ages, to affect the opinion
entertained by the civilized world of their character
and pursuits. Meanwhile the merchants, who were
chiefly engaged in the debasing traffic of slaves, and,
as may be supposed, cherished no respect for any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
thing but riches, and the power which commands
riches, looked upon their humble companion with
undisguised contempt; for imbecility and ignorance
are of themselves incapable of appreciating intellectual
superiority, and reverence it only when it is
exerted for their defence or destruction. The scorn
which our traveller entertained for those miscreants
was, therefore, just. They constantly treated him
with contumely, though he professed a belief in the
same law and the same prophets; plundered his
water-skins, or obstructed his filling them at the
wells, thus exposing him to the danger of perishing
of thirst; circulated, in the towns where they
stopped, the report that he was a spy; and, in short,
put in practice every art which their dastardly malice
and shallow brains could conceive, in order to disgust
him with the trade, and thus free themselves
from a new competitor. But they were slave-dealers:
an epithet which comprises every thing
most loathsome and abominable; and their manners
entirely corresponded with their occupation, being
marked by a degree of depravity which language
blushes to describe.</p>

<p>At the end of a week’s journey, the caravan arrived
at the celebrated wells of El Haimar, in the vicinity
of which they found the tomb of a Mameluke chief,
who died on this spot. “His companions, having
enclosed the naked corpse within low walls of loose
stones, had covered it over with a large block. The
dryness of the air had preserved the corpse in the
most perfect state. Looking at it through the interstices
of the stones which enveloped it, it appeared
to me a more perfect mummy than any I had seen in
Egypt. The mouth was wide open, and our guide
related that the man had died for want of water,
although so near the wells.” Next day they passed
Wady Ollaky, a fine valley, extending east and west
from the Nile to the Red Sea. Here were numerous
trees and excellent pasture; advantages which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
caused it to be regarded with peculiar veneration by
the Bedouins; and every man, as he traversed it on
his ass or camel, took a handful of dhourra, and
threw it on the ground, as a kind of pious offering to
the good genius of the Wady.</p>

<p>On the following day, in crossing Wady El Towashy,
or the Valley of the Eunuch, Burckhardt saw the
tomb of that Mahomet Towash whose body was
found on the sands by Bruce, three days after he had
been murdered by his guides. The principal facts
in Bruce’s narrative of this transaction Burckhardt
found to be true, but he imagined that the details of
the story must have been “made up.” Nothing
can be conceived more insolent or absurd than this
skepticism. Why should it be supposed that we
were to accept the testimony of this young man,
coming from a country where assuredly truth is not
more respected than it is in Britain, and who, compared
with Bruce, was an unknown and an inferior
person, before that of an English gentleman, whose
education was conducted with the utmost care, and
who, except as a traveller, was never regarded, I
believe, other than as a person of probity and honour?
The principle which teaches the despots of
the East to respect each other’s harems, when, by
the chances of war, they fall into their hands, as
Darius’s fell into those of Alexander, should, we
think, be acted upon by travellers, who, unless upon
the amplest and most satisfactory information, should
beware of tampering with the integrity of each other’s
characters. The contrary proceeding must, in the
end, be productive of a degree of skepticism which
would extinguish all enthusiasm and enterprise in
travellers, who, at this rate, could expect no better
fate than to be denounced as liars by every timid
knave, who, skulking by his own fireside, might be
impelled by envy to rail at those who boldly measure
sea and land, and undergo the extremity of hardships
to obtain an honourable reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Burckhardt, however, had acquired the habit of
suspecting every thing, not because he himself could
have been guilty of an untruth, for he was a high-spirited
and honourable man, but because he generalized
too hastily. I readily pardon his error, therefore,
and trust that his involuntary injustice may be
injurious neither to Bruce’s character, nor to his
own. His picture of what he endured in the course
of this journey is sufficient to account for any little
asperity of manner observable in his travels.
“For myself,” says he, in describing what daily
occurred at their halting-places, “I was often driven
from the coolest and most comfortable birth into
the burning sun, and generally passed the midday
hours in great distress; for besides the exposure to
heat, I had to cook my dinner, a service which I
could never prevail upon any of my companions,
even the poorest servants, to perform for me, though
I offered to let them share my homely fare. In the
evening the same labour occurred again, when
fatigued by the day’s journey, during which I always
walked for four or five hours, in order to spare my
ass, and when I was in the utmost need of repose.
Hunger, however, always prevailed over fatigue, and
I was obliged to fetch and cut wood, to light a fire,
to cook, to feed the ass, and finally to make coffee,
a cup of which, presented to my Daraou companions,
who were extremely eager to obtain it, was the
only means I possessed of keeping them in tolerable
good-humour. A good night’s rest, however, always
repaired my strength, and I was never in better
health and spirits than during this journey, although
its fatigues were certainly very great, and much
beyond my expectation. The common dish of all
the travellers at noon was fetyre, which is flour
mixed up with water into a liquid paste, and then
baked upon the sadj, or iron plate; butter is then
poured over it, or honey, or sometimes a sauce is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
made of butter and dried bamyé. In the evening
some lentils are boiled, or some bread is baked
with salt, either upon the sadj or in ashes, and a
sauce of bamyé, or onion, poured over lentils, or
upon the bread, after it has been crumbled into
small pieces. Early in the morning every one
eats a piece of dry biscuit, with some raw onions or
dates.”</p>

<p>On the 14th of March, on arriving at the Wady el
Nabeh, they found the celebrated wells of that valley
insufficient to supply the caravan until they should
reach the rocks of Shigre, and as no water was anywhere
to be found in the intervening space they
were reduced to the greatest perplexity. “Upon
such occasions as these,” says Burckhardt, “every
man gives his opinion: and mine was, that we
should kill our thirty-five asses, which required a
daily supply of at least fifteen water-skins, that we
should load the camels to the utmost of their strength
with water, and strike out a straight way through
the desert towards Berber, without touching at Shigre;
in this manner we might perform the journey
in five forced marches.” This plan the Arabs refused
to follow. They repaired their water-skins and their
sandals, refreshed themselves with bathing in the
cool wells, and then set out. But “it was not without
great apprehension,” says our traveller, “that I
departed from this place. Our camels and asses
carried water for three or four days only, and I saw
no possibility of escaping from the dreadful effects
of a want of water. In order to keep my ass in
good spirits, I took off the two small water-skins
with which I had hitherto loaded him, and paid one
of the Ababdes four dollars to carry four small
water-skins as far as Berber; for I thought that if
the ass could carry me, I might bear thirst for two
days at least, but that if he should break down, I
should certainly not be able to walk one whole day
without water in this hot season of the year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these difficulties and sufferings,
our traveller considered the Nubian desert, at
least as far south as Shigre, far less terrible than that
of Syria or Tyh. Trees and water are much more frequent,
and though it be intersected in various directions
by shaggy barren rocks, the more desolate and
awful appearance which it acquires from this circumstance
is, in a great measure, compensated for by its
consequent grandeur and variety. “Here,” says the
traveller, “during the whole day’s march, we were
surrounded on all sides by lakes of mirage, called by
the Arabs Serab. Its colour was of the purest
azure, and so clear that the shadows of the mountains
that bordered the horizon were reflected on it
with the greatest precision, and the delusion of its
being a sheet of water was thus rendered still more
perfect.” This mockwater, however, only served
to heighten the terrors which the scarcity of real
water excited. Every man now began to attach the
greatest importance to the small stock he possessed.
Burckhardt, who possessed but two draughts of
water in the world, drank the moiety of it at once,
reserving the remainder for the next day; but,
observing the general scarcity, shared the dejection
of his companions. At length, their condition having
become nearly desperate, they adopted the course
recommended by the Ababde chief, and despatched
ten or twelve of their companions, mounted on as
many camels, to the nearest part of the Nile, which
was not more than five or six hours distant; but its
banks being inhabited in this part by fierce hostile
tribes, nothing but the fear of instant death could
have forced them upon this step. They timed their
march in such a manner that they would reach the
banks of the river by night; when they were directed
to select some uninhabited spot, and having there
loaded their camels, to return with all speed. “We
passed the evening,” says Burckhardt, “in the
greatest anxiety, for if the camels should not return,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
we had little hopes of escape either from thirst or
from the sword of our enemies, who, if they had
once got sight of our camels, would have followed
their footsteps through the desert, and would certainly
have discovered us. Many of my companions
came in the course of the evening to beg some water
of me, but I had well hidden my treasure, and
answered them by showing my empty skins. We
remained the greater part of the night in silent and
sullen expectation of the result of our desperate
mission. At length, about three o’clock in the
morning, we heard the distant hallooings of our
companions; and soon after refreshed ourselves
with copious draughts of the delicious water of the
Nile.”</p>

<p>This was the last of their sufferings on this route;
on the 23d of March they entered on a plain with a
slight slope towards the river, which was felt at
more than two hours’ distance by the greater moisture
of the air. The Arabs exclaimed, “God be
praised, we again smell the Nile!” and about ten
o’clock at night, the caravan entered the village of
Ankhecreh, the principal place in the district of
Berber. Burckhardt’s residence at this place was
nothing but one continued series of annoyance. The
principal delight of the whole population, among
whom drunkenness and debauchery were scarcely
accounted vices, seemed to consist in deluding and
plundering travellers, who on all the envenomed soil
of Africa could scarcely be exposed to more irritating
insults or extortion than on this spot.</p>

<p>The caravan, now reduced to about two-thirds of
its original number, several of the merchants having
returned to Egypt, while others remained at Berber
to dispose of their goods, again put itself in motion
on the 7th of April. Our traveller, who had hitherto
attached himself to the merchant portion of the
party, several of whom, previous to their leaving
Egypt, had received benefits at his hands, was here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
driven by abuse and contumely to take refuge among
the Ababde, who not only willingly received him as
their companion, but exercised their influence, on
more than one occasion, to protect him from violence.
Pursuing a southerly direction for three
days, they arrived at the town of Damer, which,
under the government of a number of religious men,
had attained a very high pitch of prosperity. Their
sanctity, indeed, was considerably aided by their
skill in magic, which, as Burckhardt was credibly
informed, was so great that, on one occasion, the
Faky el Kebir, or Great Fakir, caused a lamb
to bleat in the stomach of the thief who had stolen,
and afterward eaten it. There was no daily market
at Damer, nor was there any thing whatever sold
publicly, except on the weekly market-day. However,
as our traveller needed a few measures of dhourra
for his ass, and found it impracticable to purchase
less than a dollar’s worth, which would have been
more than he could carry, he was under the necessity
of imitating his companions, and went from
house to house with some strings of beads in his
hands, offering them for sale at about four handfuls
of dhourra for each bead. “I gained at this rate,”
says he, “about sixty per cent. above the prime
cost, and had at the same time an opportunity of
entering many private houses. I repeated these
walks every day during our stay. One afternoon,
while crying my beads for sale, I was accosted by a
faky, who asked me if I could read. On my
answering in the affirmative, he desired me to follow
him to a place where, he said, I might expect to get
a good dinner. He then led me to a house where I
found a great number of people, collected to celebrate
the memory of some relative lately deceased.
Several fakies were reading the Koran in a low tone
of voice. A great faky afterward came in, whose
arrival was the signal for reciting the Koran in loud
songs, in the manner customary in the East, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
which I joined them. This was continued for about
half an hour, until dinner was brought in, which was
very plentiful, as a cow had been killed upon the
occasion. After a hearty meal, we recommenced
our reading. One of the sheïkhs produced a basketful
of white pebbles, over which several prayers
were read. These pebbles were destined to be
strewed over the tomb of the deceased in the manner
which I had often observed upon tombs freshly
made. Upon my inquiries respecting this custom,
which I confessed to have never before seen practised
in any Mohammedan country, the faky answered
that it was a mere meritorious action: that there
was no absolute necessity for it; but that it was
thought that the soul of the deceased, when hereafter
visiting the tomb, might be glad to find these
pebbles, in order to use them as beads in addressing
its prayers to the Creator. When the reading was
over, the women began to sing and howl. I then
left the room, and on taking my departure my kind
host put some bones of roasted meat in my hand to
serve for my supper.”</p>

<p>In proceeding from this place to Shendy the caravan
was accompanied by several fakies, whose presence
was found to be a sufficient protection against
the Nubian Bedouins. They reached Shendy on the
17th of April, and this being, next to Sennaar and
Kobbe, the largest town in eastern Soudan, they remained
here a whole month, during which time
Burckhardt enjoyed an ample opportunity of collecting
materials for an account of this and the neighbouring
countries. Crocodiles are numerous in this
part of the Nile. They are much dreaded by the
inhabitants, who, when repairing to its banks for
water or to wash their linen, are in constant fear of
these creatures. Burckhardt ate of the crocodile’s
flesh, which he found of a dirty white colour, not
unlike young veal, with a slight fishy smell. To
bring its flesh into fashion as an article of food
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
would be the most certain way of rendering it
rare.</p>

<p>At this place Burckhardt abandoned all idea of
proceeding farther south, and, in order to procure
himself some little civility from his former companions,
circulated the report that he intended to
return directly to Egypt, where, by describing to the
pasha their conduct towards him during the journey,
he might do them considerable injury. This stratagem
succeeded. Their civility and affected friendship
now surpassed their former insolence. In the mean
while, understanding that a caravan was about to
set out for Suakin on the Red Sea, our traveller prevailed
on the Ababde chief to introduce and recommend
him as his own friend to its leader. Here he
disposed of his merchandise, and purchased a slave-boy
to attend upon him on the road; and having
laid in the necessary quantity of provisions, joined the
Suakin caravan, and departed from Shendy on the
17th of May. “After all my accounts were settled,”
says he, “I had four dollars left; but the smallness
of the sum occasioned me no uneasiness, for I calculated
on selling my camel on the coast for as much
as would defray the expenses of my voyage to Jidda,
and I had a letter of credit on that place for a considerable
sum, which I had procured at Cairo.”</p>

<p>The road now traversed by the caravan crossed
the Atbara, the Astaboras of the ancients, on the
banks of which they found numerous groves of trees,
and the most luxuriant vegetation. At the sight of
this, the imagination even of the slave-dealers was
touched with enthusiasm; and in alluding to the
dreary track over which they had travelled, one of
them exclaimed, “After death comes paradise!”
“There was a greater variety of natural vegetation
here than I had seen anywhere on the banks of the
Nile in Egypt. I observed different species of the
mimosa, doom-trees of the largest size, whose luxuriant
clusters of fruit excited the wishes of the
slaves, the nebek-tree, with its fruit ripe; the allobé,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
of the size of the nebek, besides a great number of
others unknown to me; to these may be added an
abundance of wild herbage, growing on a rich fat
soil, similar to that of Egypt. The trees were inhabited
by great numbers of the feathered tribe, whose
song travellers in Egypt very rarely hear. I saw no
birds with rich plumage, but observed small ones of
several different kinds. Some sweet notes struck
my ears, which I had never before heard, and the
amorous cooings of the turtle-dove were unceasing.
We hastened to the river, and eagerly descended
its low banks to allay our thirst. Several camels,
at the sight of the water, broke the halters by which
they were led, and in rushing or stumbling down the
banks threw off their loads, and occasioned great
clamour and disorder.”</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Goz Rajeb, Burckhardt saw on
the summit of a hill the ruins of a huge fabric of ancient
times, but was deterred from visiting it by the
assertion of his companions that it was the haunt
of banditti. On the 5th of June, while the caravan
halted at an encampment of Hadendoa Bedouins,
Burckhardt beheld the effects of a desert storm:
“Towards evening we were visited by another hurricane,
the most tremendous I ever remember to
have witnessed. A dark blue cloud first appeared,
extending to about 25° above the horizon; as it approached
nearer, and increased in height, it assumed
an ash-gray colour, with a tinge of yellow, striking
every person in the caravan who had not been accustomed
to such phenomena with amazement at
its magnificent and terrific appearance; as the cloud
approached still nearer, the yellow tinge became
more general, while the horizon presented the
brightest azure. At last, it burst upon us in its rapid
course, and involved us in darkness and confusion;
nothing could be distinguished at the distance of
five or six feet; our eyes were filled with dust; our
temporary sheds were blown down at the first gust,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
and many of the more firmly fixed tents of the Hadendoa
followed; the largest withstood for a time
the effects of the blast, but were at last obliged to
yield, and the whole camp was levelled with the
ground. In the mean time the terrified camels arose,
broke the cords by which they were fastened, and
endeavoured to escape from the destruction which
appeared to threaten them; thus adding not a little
to our embarrassment. After blowing about half an
hour with incessant violence, the wind suddenly
abated, and when the atmosphere became clear, the
tremendous cloud was seen continuing its havoc to
the north-west.”</p>

<p>Next day they reached Taka, a district famous for
its fertility, where hares, gazelles, wolves, giraffes,
and limes as large, it was said, as cows, were found
in the woods. Hence, after a stay of several days,
they departed for Suakin, and after a not unpleasant
journey through a wild, picturesque country, approached
the termination of their toils. On the
morning of the last day they started before sunrise.
“The eastern hills,” says Burckhardt, “terminate
in this latitude; and the sun was just rising beyond
them, when we descried its reflection at an immense
distance in the sea, affording a pleasing sight to
every individual in the caravan, but most of all to
me.” At length, on the 26th of June, they reached
Suakin, and pitched their little sheds at about twenty
minutes’ walk from the town. Next day they were
visited by the emir, who, understanding that our
traveller’s camel was an excellent animal, determined
on taking it as a part of the caravan dues; upon
which Burckhardt insisted upon referring their difference
to the Turkish custom-house officer. His
wishes were quickly complied with, but the aga, instead
of interfering to protect the stranger, immediately
conceived the idea of uniting with the emir in
seizing upon the whole of his property; and therefore,
pretending to regard him as a Mameluke spy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
began at once to overwhelm him with abuse. To
all this Burckhardt returned no reply, but requested
the aga to inform him whether the emir was entitled
to his camel. “Not only thy camel,” replied the
Turk, “but thy whole baggage must be taken and
searched. We shall render a good account of them
to the pasha, depend upon it. You shall not impose
upon us, you rascal; and you may be thankful if
we do not cut off your head!” Our traveller protested
that he was nothing but an unfortunate merchant,
and endeavoured, by a submissive deportment,
to pacify his anger; but “he began cursing and
swearing in Turkish,” says Burckhardt, “and then
calling an old cripple, to whom he had given the title
of waly, or police-officer, he ordered him to tie my
hands, to put me in prison, and to bring my slave
and baggage into his presence. I now thought it
high time to produce my firmans, which I drew from
a secret pocket in my thaboot; one of them was
written in Turkish, upon a piece of paper two feet
and a half in length, and one foot in breadth, and
was sealed with the great seal of Mohammed Aly;
the other, a smaller one, was written in Arabic, and
bore the seal of Ibrahim Pasha, his son, in which
Ibrahim termed me ‘Our man, Ibrahim, the Syrian.’
When Yemak saw the firmans unfolded, he became
completely stupified, and the persons present looked
at me with amazement. The aga could read the
Arabic only; but he kissed them both, put them to
his forehead, and then protested to me, in the most
submissive terms, that it was the good of the public
service alone that had led him to treat me as he had
done, and for which he begged me a thousand pardons.
Nothing more was said about the emir’s right
to my camel, and he declared that I should pay no
duty for my slave, though he was entitled to it.”</p>

<p>Burckhardt now disposed of his camel, and took
his passage to Jidda in one of the country vessels.
After tossing about the Red Sea for nearly a fortnight,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
visiting Macouar, and several points of the
African coast, he arrived at Jidda on the 18th of
July, 1814. His first care now was to present his
letter of credit, which being of an old date, however,
he was refused payment, though the merchant offered
him a lodging at his house. This he accepted,
but removed, two days afterward, to a public khan,
where he was attacked by a fever, in which he lay
delirious for several days. His recovery from this
violent disorder, which he attributed to his indulging
in the fine fruits of the Jidda market, seems to have
been chiefly owing to the kindness of a Greek captain,
who, having been his fellow-passenger from
Suakin, attended him during one of his lucid intervals,
and, at his own request, procured a barber,
who bled him copiously.</p>

<p>Here our traveller was reduced to the hard necessity
of parting with his slave, for whom he obtained
forty-eight dollars, of which thirty-two were profit.
With this he dressed himself in the guise of a reduced
Egyptian gentleman, and determined to remain
in the Hejaz until the time of the pilgrimage
in the following November. However, as his funds
were far too low to enable him to live independently
until that period, he began to turn his thoughts towards
manual labour; but first determined upon
trying the effect of a direct application to Mohammed Aly,
then at Tayef. He accordingly wrote to
his highness’s Armenian physician, who was likewise
at Tayef with his master, requesting him to
learn from the pasha whether he would accept a bill
upon Burckhardt’s correspondent at Cairo, and
order his treasurer at Jidda to pay the amount of it.
Before the result of this application could be known,
he received an invitation to the house of Tousoun
Pasha’s physician, who, upon being made acquainted
with the state of his finances, kindly offered him the
sum of three thousand piasters (about 100<i>l.</i>) for a
bill upon Cairo payable at sight. Mohammed Aly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
to whom his condition was accidentally made known,
immediately despatched a messenger with two dromedaries,
an order for five hundred piasters, and a request
that he would repair immediately with the
same messenger to Tayef. With this invitation,
which was, in fact, equivalent to a command, he
thought it necessary to comply, and accordingly
set off on the same afternoon (24th of August) for
the interior of the Hejaz.</p>

<p>They were accompanied during the first portion
of the way by about twenty camel-drivers of the tribe
of Harb, who were carrying money to Mecca for
the pasha’s treasury. The road at first lay over a
barren sandy plain, ascending slightly as it receded
from the sea; it then entered the narrow gorges of a
mountainous country, where they overtook a caravan
of pilgrims, who were accompanying a quantity
of goods and provisions destined for the army. The
pasha, who, no doubt, suspected the sincerity of our
traveller’s creed, had given orders to the guide to
conduct him by a by-road to Tayef, which lay to
the north of Mecca: “Just before we left Hadda,”
says Burckhardt, “my guide, who knew nothing
further respecting me than that I had business with
the pasha at Tayef, that I performed all the outward
observances of a Moslem pilgrim, and that I had
been liberal to him before our departure, asked me
the reason of his having been ordered to take me
by the northern road. I replied that it was probably
thought shorter than the other. ‘That is a mistake,’
he replied; ‘the Mecca road is quite as short, and much
safer; and if you have no objection we will proceed
by it.’ This was just what I wished, though I had
taken care not to betray any anxiety on the subject;
and we accordingly followed the great road, in company
with the other travellers.”</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, Burckhardt saw but
little of the sacred city, as the guide, who had no
curiosity to gratify, hurried through the streets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
without allowing him time for observation. Continuing
their journey, therefore, towards the east,
they arrived, on the 27th of August, at Ras el Kora,
where they passed the night. “This,” says our
traveller, “is the most beautiful spot in the Hejaz,
and more picturesque and delightful than any spot
I had seen since my departure from Lebanon, in
Syria. The top of Jebel Kora is flat, but large
masses of granite lie scattered over it, the surface
of which, like that of the granite rocks near the
sacred cataract of the Nile, is blackened by the sun.
Several small rivulets descend from this peak, and
irrigate the plain, which is covered with verdant
fields, and large shady trees, on the side of the granite
rocks. To those who have only known the dreary
and scorching sands of the lower country of the
Hejaz, this scene is as surprising as the keen air
which blows here is refreshing. Many of the fruit-trees
of Europe are found here; figs, apricots,
peaches, apples, the Egyptian sycamore, almonds,
pomegranates; but particularly vines, the produce of
which is of the best quality.” “After having passed
through this delightful district for about half an hour,
just as the sun was rising, when every leaf and blade
of grass was covered with a balmy dew, and every
tree and shrub diffused a fragrance as delicious to
the smell as was the landscape to the eye, I halted
near the largest of the rivulets, which, although
not more than two paces across, nourishes upon its
banks a green alpine turf, such as the mighty Nile,
with all its luxuriance, can never produce in Egypt.”</p>

<p>Upon his reaching Tayef, he caused his arrival to
be made known to the pasha, who, upon learning his
desire to visit the Holy Cities, expressed a desire
to see him late in the evening at his public residence,
and observed jocosely to the Kadhy of Mecca, who
happened to be present, “It is not the beard alone
which proves a man to be a true Moslem; but you
are a better judge in such matters than I am.” Our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
traveller, on learning these particulars, affected to
be much hurt by the pasha’s suspicions, and let the
physician, who was the bearer of the message, know
that he should not go to the pasha’s public audience
unless he was received as a Turk. When the physician
delivered this message, Mohammed Aly smiled,
and said that he was welcome, whether Turk or not.
The audience passed off well. But Burckhardt clearly
discovered that he was regarded as a spy of the
English government; that his conduct was narrowly
watched; and that, in being made the guest of the
physician, he was a kind of prisoner, all whose
words and actions were reported to the pasha. This
was by no means an agreeable position. He therefore
determined to be delivered from it; and, in
order to effect his purpose, adopted the most prudent
plan that could have been imagined: he rendered
himself so troublesome and expensive to his host,
that the latter, in order to be freed from him, represented
him in the most favourable light to his master,
and contrived to obtain him permission to spend the
last days of the Ramadhan at Mecca.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the 7th of September, Burckhardt
departed in company with the kadhy for the Holy
City. On passing Wady Mohram, he assumed the
<i>ihram</i>, the dress worn by all pilgrims during the
Hadj, and consisting of two pieces of linen, woollen,
or cotton cloth, one of which is wrapped round the
loins, while the other is thrown over the neck and
shoulders, so as to leave part of the right arm bare.
In this dress he arrived at Mecca, on the 9th of September;
and, as the law enjoins, proceeded immediately
to visit the temple, before he had attended
to any worldly concern whatever. The ceremonies
practised on this occasion are long and tedious,
the Mohammedans apparently believing, like our
monkish madmen in Europe, that whatever is painful
or disgusting to man must therefore be pleasing
to God. Having completed these absurdities, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
hired a ready-furnished lodging in the house of a
metowaf, or guide to the holy places; who, while
the poor hajjî was occupied with his devotions, employed
his spare moments industriously in stealing
whatever he could from his travelling-sack.</p>

<p>Being desirous of completing his travelling equipments
before the commencement of the Hadj,
Burckhardt now proceeded to Jidda, where such
things are more easily procured than at Mecca, and
again returned about the middle of October, with a
slave-boy whom he purchased. He hired apartments
in an unfrequented part of the city, where he enjoyed
the advantage of several large trees growing
before his windows, “the verdure of which,” says
he, “among the barren and sunburnt rocks of
Mecca, was to me more exhilarating than the finest
landscape could have been under different circumstances.”
The principal curiosity of Mecca is the
Beitullah, or House of God, a species of quadrangle,
in the centre of which stands the Kaaba, “an
oblong massive structure, eighteen paces in length,
fourteen in breadth, and from thirty-five to forty feet
in height. It is constructed of the gray Mecca
stone, in large blocks of different sizes, joined together
in a very rough manner, and with bad cement.”
“At the north-east corner of the Kaaba,
near the door, is the famous ‘Black Stone;’ it forms
a part of the sharp angle of the building at four or
five feet above the ground. It is an irregular oval
of about seven inches in diameter, with an undulating
surface, composed of about a dozen smaller
stones of different sizes and shapes, well joined together
with a small quantity of cement, and perfectly
smoothed. It looks as if the whole had been
broken into many pieces by a violent blow, and then
united again. It is very difficult to determine accurately
the quality of this stone, which has been
worn to its present surface by the millions of
touches and kisses it has received. It appeared to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
me like a laver, containing several small extraneous
particles, of a whitish and of a yellowish substance.
Its colour is now a deep reddish brown, approaching
to black: it is surrounded on all sides by a border,
composed of a substance which I took to be a close
cement of pitch and gravel, of a similar, but not
quite the same, brownish colour. This border serves
to support its detached pieces; it is two or three
inches in breadth, and rises a little above the surface
of the stone. Both the border and the stone
itself are encircled by a silver band, broader below
than above, and on the two sides, with a considerable
swelling below, as if a part of the stone were
hidden under it. The lower part of the border is
studded with silver nails.”</p>

<p>I have purposely made use of Burckhardt’s own
words in describing the Black Stone, and several
other objects of curiosity, that the reader may see
the exact impressions which they made on the mind
of the traveller; though, as his style is very diffuse,
it would frequently not have been difficult to compress
his meaning into a much smaller compass. I
cannot, however, pursue the same course with his
description of the Hadj; which, notwithstanding its
interest, is far too voluminous for the space which
I can bestow upon it. On the 21st of November,
1814, the approach of the Syrian caravan was announced
by a messenger, whose horse dropped down
dead the moment he dismounted. Several other
persons followed in about two hours after; and during
the night, the main body, with the Pasha of Damascus
at its head, came up, and encamped in the
plain of Sheïkh Mahmoud. Next morning the
Egyptian caravan likewise arrived; and at the same
time Mohammed Aly, who desired to be present at
the Hadj, appeared unexpectedly at Mecca, dressed
in an ihram composed of two magnificent shawls of
Kashmeer. All the hajjîs residing in the city now
assumed the ihram, with the usual ceremonies, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
their own lodgings, preparatory to their setting out
for Arafat, and at noon heard a short sermon in the
mosque.</p>

<p>The city was now full of movement and activity:
all the pilgrims were preparing to set out for Arafat,
some running hither and thither in search of lodgings,
others visiting the markets, or the Kaaba. Many Meccawys,
engaged in petty traffic, were hastening to
establish themselves on the mountain, for the accommodation
of the pilgrims. Camel-drivers led
their beasts through the streets, offering them to the
pilgrims for hire. On the 24th of November, the
Syrian caravan, with the Mahmal, or sacred camel,
in front, passed in procession through the city. The
majority of the pilgrims rode in a species of palanquin,
placed upon their camels; but the Pasha of
Damascus, and other grandees, were mounted in
tackhtravans, or splendid litters, which were borne
by two camels. The heads of these picturesque
animals were decorated with feathers, tassels, and
bells. Crowds of people of all classes lined the
streets, and greeted the pilgrims as they passed with
loud acclamations and praise. The martial music
of the pasha, twelve finely-caparisoned horses led
in front of his tackhtravan, and the rich litters in
which his women rode, particularly attracted attention.
The Egyptian caravan followed soon after,
and, consisting entirely of military pilgrims in the
splendid Turkish costume, was no less admired than
its predecessor. Both continued, without stopping,
their march to Arafat, and were almost immediately
followed by the other pilgrims in the city, and by far
the greater proportion of the population of Mecca and
Jidda, among whom our traveller likewise proceeded
to the sacred hill.</p>

<p>Burckhardt reached the camp about three hours
after sunset. The pilgrims were still wandering
about the plain, and among the tents, in search of
their companions, or of their resting-place, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
many did not arrive until midnight. Numberless
fires glimmered upon the dark plain to the extent of
several miles; and high and brilliant clusters of
lamps marked the different places of encampment
of Mohammed Aly, Soleyman Pasha, and the Emir
el Hadj of the Egyptian caravan. Few slept: “the
devotees set up praying, and their loud chants were
particularly distinguished on the side of the Syrian
encampment. The merry Meccawys formed themselves
into parties, singing jovial songs, accompanied
by clapping of hands; and the coffee-houses
scattered over the plain were crowded all night with
customers. The night was dark and cold. I had
formed a resting-place for myself by means of a
large carpet tied to the back of a Meccawy’s tent;
and having walked about for the greater part of the
night, I had just disposed myself to sleep, when two
guns, fired by the Syrian and Egyptian Hadj, announced
the approaching dawn of the day of pilgrimage,
and summoned the faithful to prepare for
their morning prayers.”</p>

<p>The scene which, on the unfolding of the dawn,
presented itself to the eye of the traveller, was one
of the most extraordinary upon earth. “Every pilgrim
issued from his tent to walk over the plains,
and take a view of the busy crowds assembled there.
Long streets of tents, fitted up as bazaars, furnished
all kinds of provisions. The Syrian and Egyptian
cavalry were exercised by their chiefs early in the
morning, while thousands of camels were seen feeding
upon the dry shrubs of the plain all round the
camp.” Burckhardt now ascended the summit of
Arafat, whence he could enjoy a distant view of the
whole, the mountain being an isolated mass of
granite, and reaching the height of two hundred
feet above the level of the plain. From this point
he counted about three thousand tents, but the far
greater number were, like himself, without tents.
Twenty or twenty-five thousand camels were dispersed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
in separate groups, over the plain; and the
number of pilgrims of both sexes, and of all classes,
could not amount to less than seventy thousand.
“The Syrian Hadj was encamped on the south and
south-west side of the mountain; the Egyptian on
the south-east. Around the house of the Sherif,
Yahya himself was encamped with his Bedouin
troops, and in its neighbourhood were all the Hejaz
people. Mohammed Aly, and Soleyman, Pasha of
Damascus, as well as several of their officers, had
very handsome tents; but the most magnificent of
all was that of the wife of Mohammed Aly, the
mother of Tousoun Pasha and Ibrahim Pasha, who
had lately arrived at Cairo for the Hadj, with a truly
royal equipage, five hundred camels being necessary
to transport her baggage from Jidda to Mecca. Her
tent was in fact an encampment, consisting of a
dozen tents of different sizes, inhabited by her women;
the whole enclosed by a wall of linen cloth,
eight hundred paces in circuit, the single entrance to
which was guarded by eunuchs in splendid dresses.
Around this enclosure were pitched the tents of the
men who formed her numerous suite. The beautiful
embroidery on the exterior of this linen palace,
with the various colours displayed in every part of
it, constituted an object which reminded me of some
descriptions in the Arabian Tales of the Thousand
and One Nights.”</p>

<p>Among the prodigious crowd were persons from
every corner of the Mohammedan world. Burckhardt
counted forty different languages, and did not
doubt that there were many more. About three
o’clock in the afternoon, the pilgrims, quitting their
tents, which were immediately struck, and mounting
their camels, pressed forward towards Mount Arafat,
and covered its sides from top to bottom. The
preacher now took his stand upon the platform on
the mountain, and began to address the multitude.
The hearing of the sermon, which lasts till sunset,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
constitutes the holy ceremony of the Hadj, and
without being present at it, and at least appearing
to hear, no pilgrim is entitled to the name of hajjî.
“The two pashas, with their whole cavalry drawn
up in two squadrons behind them, took their post in
the rear of the deep line of camels of the hajjîs,
to which those of the people of the Hejaz were also
joined: and here they waited in solemn and respectful
silence the conclusion of the sermon. Farther
removed from the preacher was the Sherif Yahya,
with his small body of soldiers, distinguished by
several green standards carried before him. The
two Mahmals, or holy camels, which carry on their
backs the high structure that serves as the banner
of their respective caravans, made way with difficulty
through the ranks of camels that encircled the
southern and eastern sides of the hill, opposite to
the preacher, and took their station, surrounded by
their guards, directly under the platform in front of
him. The preacher, or khatyb, who is usually the
Kadhy of Mecca, was mounted upon a finely-caparisoned
camel, which had been led up the steps; it
being traditionally said that Mohammed was always
seated when he addressed his followers, a practice
in which he was imitated by all the califs who came
to the Hadj, and who from hence addressed their
subjects in person. The Turkish gentleman of
Constantinople, however, unused to camel-riding,
could not keep his seat so well as the hardy Bedouin
prophet; and the camel becoming unruly, he was
soon obliged to alight from it. He read his sermon
from a book in Arabic, which he held in his hands.
At intervals of every four or five minutes he paused,
and stretched forth his arms to implore blessings
from above; while the assembled multitudes around
and before him waved the skirts of their ihrams
over their heads, and rent the air with shouts of
<i>Lebeyk, Allah, huma Lebeyk!</i>&mdash;“Here we are at thy
bidding, O God!” During the wavings of the ihrams,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
the side of the mountain, thickly crowded as it was
by the people in their white garments, had the appearance
of a cataract of water; while the green
umbrellas, with which several thousand hajjîs, sitting
on their camels below, were provided, bore
some resemblance to a verdant plain.”</p>

<p>Burckhardt was present at all the remaining ceremonies
of the Hadj, which I shall not now pause to
describe; and after observing whatever was worthy
of examination both at Mecca and Jidda, he joined a
small caravan of pilgrims who were going to visit the
tomb of the prophet, and set out for Medina on the
15th of January, 1815. During this journey he imprudently
advanced before the caravan, and was
attacked by five Bedouins, from whom he was
quickly delivered, however, by the approach of his
companions. They reached Medina on the 28th of
January. The ceremonies practised in this city
were much less tedious than at Mecca, and did not
occupy our traveller more than a quarter of an hour.
Here, shortly after his arrival, he was attacked by
an intermittent fever, accompanied by extraordinary
despondency. His condition, indeed, was well calculated
to inspire gloomy thoughts; for he had no
society, and but one book, which was, however, as
he observes, worth a whole shelf full of others.
This was a pocket edition of Milton, which he had
borrowed from an English ship at Jidda.</p>

<p>Medina, it is well known, is chiefly indebted to the
tomb of Mohammed for its celebrity. This mausoleum,
which stands on the south-eastern corner of
the principal mosque, is protected from the too near
approach of visiters by an iron railing, painted green,
about two-thirds the height of the pillars of the
colonnade which runs round the interior of the
mosque. “The railing is of good workmanship, in
imitation of filligree, and is interwoven with open-worked
inscriptions of yellow bronze, supposed by
the vulgar to be of gold, and of so close a texture,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
that no view can be obtained of the interior except
by several small windows about six inches square,
which are placed in the four sides of the railing,
about five feet above the ground.” On the south
side, where are the two principal windows, before
which the devout stand when praying, the railing is
plated with silver, and the common inscription&mdash;“There
is no God but God, the Evident Truth”&mdash;is
wrought in silver letters round the windows. The
tomb itself, as well as that of Abu Bekr and Omar,
which stand close to it, is concealed from the public
gaze by a curtain of rich silk brocade of various colours,
interwoven with silver flowers and arabesques,
with inscriptions in characters of gold running across
the midst of it, like that of the covering of the
Kaaba. Behind this curtain, which, according to
the historian of the city, was formerly changed every
six years, and is now renewed by the Porte whenever
the old one is decayed, or when a new sultan
ascends the throne, none but the chief eunuchs, the
attendants of the mosque, are permitted to enter.
This holy sanctuary once served, as the temple of
Delphi did among the Greeks, as the public treasury
of the nation. Here the money, jewels, and other
precious articles of the people of the Hejaz were
kept in chests, or suspended on silken ropes. Among
these was a copy of the Koran in Kufic characters;
a brilliant star set in diamonds and pearls, which
was suspended directly over the prophet’s tomb;
with all sorts of vessels set with jewels, earrings,
bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments, sent as
presents from all parts of the empire. Most of these
articles were carried away by the Wahabees when
they sacked and plundered the sacred cities.</p>

<p>On the 21st of April, 1815, Burckhardt quitted Medina
with a small caravan bound for Yembo, on the
seacoast. His mind was still exceedingly depressed
by the weak state of his body; and his gayety and
animal spirits, with the energy which accompanies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
them in ardent minds, having deserted him, the
world assumed in his eyes a sombre aspect, which
rendered travelling and every other pleasure insipid.
All he now sighed for was rest. This mental condition seems
strongly to have affected even his opinions.
His views both of men and things became
cynical. Vice seemed to have spread like a deluge
over the eastern world, leaving no single spot whereon
Virtue might rest the sole of her foot. “For my
own part,” says he, “<i>a long residence</i> among Turks,
Syrians, and Egyptians <i>justifies me in declaring that
they are wholly deficient in virtue, honour, and justice</i>;
that they have <i>little true piety</i>, and <i>still less charity or
forbearance</i>; and that <i>honesty</i> is only to be found in
their <i>paupers or idiots</i>.” His mind was certainly labouring
under the effects of his Medina fever when
he wrote this passage, and it would therefore be lost
labour to analyze or confute it minutely. That
people who are “wholly deficient in virtue, honour,
and justice” should be destitute of honesty, is no
more to be wondered at than that a black camel
should not be half-white; but if “true piety” be, as
most moralists will admit, to be numbered among
the virtues, then the orientals are not, as Mr. Burckhardt
asserts, “<i>wholly</i> deficient in virtue,” &amp;c., since
he allows that they have some, though but little,
“true piety.” Again, either the majority of the orientals
are rich, or the majority of them are honest;
for if the majority of them are poor, or paupers, then
the majority of them are honest; for honesty, we
are told, is only to be found among paupers and
idiots. It would be easy to expose and refute our
traveller’s assertion by the direct testimony of persons
still more competent than he to decide on such
points; but his opinion is palpably absurd, like most
others formed by sick or gloomy individuals, since
no society could subsist if formed entirely of vicious
members. Had Burckhardt himself lived to see his
works through the press, such passages as the above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
would, I am persuaded, have been expunged or modified;
for he was much too judicious deliberately to
have hazarded so monstrous an assertion.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at Yembo, dejected and melancholy,
to add to his despondency, he found the plague
raging in the city. The air, night and day, was filled
with the piercing cries of those who had been bereaved
of the objects of their affection; yet, as no
vessel was ready to sail for Egypt, he was constrained
to remain during eighteen days in the midst
of the dying and the dead, continually exposed to
infection through the heedlessness and the imprudence
of his slave. At length, however, he procured
a passage in an open boat bound for Cosseir, many
of the passengers in which were sick of a disease
which appeared to be the plague, though only two
of them died. After remaining twenty days on
board, he was, at his own request, put on shore in
the harbour of Sherin, at the entrance of the Gulf
of Akaba, where he agreed with some Bedouins to
transport him and his slave to Tor and Suez. Learning
on the way, however, that the plague was at
Suez, he remained at a village in the vicinity of the
former place, where the enjoyment of tranquillity
and a bracing mountain air soon restored his strength,
and enabled him, though still convalescent, to pursue
his journey to Cairo, where he arrived on the
24th of June, after an absence of nearly two years
and a half. As his health was not yet completely
recovered, he undertook a journey into Lower Egypt
during the following winter, which, as he seems to
have believed, restored his constitution to its former
tone.</p>

<p>His time was now entirely occupied in writing the
journal of his Nubian and Arabian travels, and in
the necessary care of his health, which, notwithstanding
his sanguine expectation to the contrary,
was still in a somewhat equivocal state. In the
spring of 1816 the plague again broke out at Cairo,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
and our traveller, to avoid the infection, undertook a
journey to Mount Sinai, intending to remain, until
the pestilence should be over, among the Bedouins,
who are never visited by this scourge. During this
excursion he traced the course of the eastern branch
of the Red Sea to within sight of Akaba, the ancient
Ælanas, which he was prevented by circumstances
from visiting. On his return to Cairo, he united with
Mr. Salt in furnishing Belzoni with money for transporting
the head of Memnon from Gournou to Alexandria.
The scheme, it would seem, originated with
Burckhardt and Salt, to whom, therefore, we are
chiefly indebted for the possession of that extraordinary
specimen of ancient art.</p>

<p>On the 4th of October, 1817, Burckhardt, who had
so long waited in vain for an opportunity of penetrating
with a Moggrebin caravan into Africa, was
attacked with violent dysentery. The best medical
advice which an eminent English physician (Doctor
Richardson), then at Cairo, could afford was found
unavailing. The disease prevailed, and on the 15th
of the same month our able, adventurous, and lamented
traveller breathed his last. As he had lived
while in the East as a Mussulman, the Turks, he
foresaw, would claim his body, “and perhaps,” said
he to Mr. Salt, who was present at his death-bed,
“you had better let them.”&mdash;“The funeral, as he desired,”
says this gentleman, “was Mohammedan,
conducted with all proper regard to the respectable
rank which he had held in the eyes of the natives.”
This was honourable to his Cairo friends; and to
those who are interested in the history of his manly
career it is gratifying to discover how highly he was
valued. I have closed the lives of few travellers
with more regret. It would have given me extreme
pleasure to have followed him through those undiscovered
regions whither his ardent imagination so
anxiously tended; and, instead of thus recording his
untimely death, to have beheld him enjoying in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
first capital of the world the reward of his courage
and enterprise. That I cannot enter into all Mr.
Burckhardt’s views, either of men or things, is no
reason why I should not be sensible of his extraordinary
merit. His character, upon the whole, admirably
fitted him to be a great traveller. He was
bold, patient, persevering, judicious. He penetrated
with admirable tact into the designs of his enemies,
and not only knew how to prevent them, but, what
was more difficult, to turn them to the confusion of
their inventors. Upon this very excellence, however,
was based one of his principal defects; he interpreted
men in too refined and systematical a
manner, and often saw in their actions more contrivance
than ever existed. He was too hasty,
moreover, in believing evil of mankind, which, with
too many other able speculators, he supposed to be
the necessary consequence of a philosophical spirit.
But he was a young man. His mind, had he lived,
would unquestionably have purified itself from this
stain, as truth, which he possessed the courage and
the ability to search for with success, was his only
object. The works which he has left behind him,
exceedingly numerous considering his brief career,
are an imperishable monument of his genius and enterprise,
and, when the fate of the writer is reflected
on, can never be read without a feeling of deep interest
almost amounting to emotion. Fortunately
for his fame, their publication has been superintended
by editors every way qualified for the task, who,
without in the least dissipating their originality,
must in very many instances have infinitely improved
their style and arrangement. A popular edition of
the whole would at once be a benefit to the public
and an additional honour to the memory of Burckhardt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VOLNEY">CONSTANTIN FRANCOIS CHASSEBŒUF
DE VOLNEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">Born 1757.&mdash;Died 1820.</p>

<p>This traveller, who is very justly enumerated
among the most distinguished which France has produced,
was born on the 3d of February, 1757, at
Craon, in Anjou. His father, an able provincial barrister,
was unwilling that he should bear the name
of <i>Chassebœuf</i> (ox or bull hunter), which in his own
case had been, though we are not told how, a source
of a thousand uneasinesses, and therefore gave his
son the name of Boisgirais, under which appellation
our traveller studied at the colleges of Ancenis and
Angers, and was at first known in the world. At a
later period, just as he was about to depart for the
East, he quitted the name of Boisgirais, and assumed
that of Volney, which he was shortly after to render
so celebrated.</p>

<p>Becoming his own master at the age of seventeen,
with a small independence bequeathed him by his
mother, he quitted the country for Paris, where he
applied himself to the study of the severer sciences.
Volney felt no inclination for the profession of a barrister,
which it was his father’s desire he should follow;
physic appeared to have greater charms for
him, and he at first seemed disposed to adopt this as
his profession; but his speculative turn of mind soon
led him to look with disdain on its practical part.
Scarcely had he reached his twentieth year when he
entered with enthusiasm into the study of the science
of nature, delighting to discover the relations
which subsist between the moral and the physical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
world. He moreover devoted a portion of his time
to the study of the history and languages of antiquity.</p>

<p>When he had made these preparations, apparently
without foreseeing to what use he should apply them,
a small inheritance which fell to him put him in possession
of two hundred and forty pounds. “The
difficulty was,” he observes, “how to employ it.
Some of my friends advised me to enjoy the capital,
others to purchase an annuity; but, on reflection, I
thought the sum too inconsiderable to make any
sensible addition to my income, and too great to be
dissipated in frivolous expenses. Some fortunate
circumstances had habituated me to study; I had
acquired a taste, and even a passion, for knowledge;
and this accession of fortune appeared to me a fresh
means of gratifying my inclination, and opening a
new way to improvement. I had read, and frequently
heard repeated, that of all the methods of
adorning the mind and forming the judgment, travelling
is the most efficacious. I determined, therefore,
on a plan of travelling; but to what part of the
world I should direct my course remained still to be
chosen. I wished the scene of my observations to
be new, or at least brilliant. My own country and
the neighbouring nations seemed to me either too
well known or too easy of access; the rising States
of America and the savages were not without their
temptations; but other considerations determined
me in favour of Asia. Syria especially, and Egypt,
both with a view of what they once have been, and
what they now are, appeared to me a field equally
adapted to those political and moral observations
with which I wished to occupy my mind.”</p>

<p>Foreseeing the fatigues and dangers of such a
journey, he occupied a whole year in preparing himself
to undertake it, by accustoming his body to the
most violent exercises and the most painful privations.
At length, all his preparatory arrangements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
being completed, he commenced his journey on foot,
with a knapsack on his back, a musket on his shoulder,
and two hundred and forty pounds in gold concealed
in his girdle. “When I set out from Marseilles
in 1783,” says he, “it was with all my heart;
with that alacrity, that confidence in others and in
myself which youth inspires. I gayly quitted a
country of peace and abundance to live in a country
of barbarism and misery, from no other motive than
to employ the active and restless moments of youth,
to acquire a new kind of knowledge, which might
procure for the remainder of my days a certain portion
of reputation and honour.”</p>

<p>On arriving in Egypt he proceeded to Cairo, where
he remained during seven months; after which, finding
that there existed too many obstacles to a proper
examination of the interior parts of the country, and
that too little assistance in learning Arabic was to
be obtained, he determined on travelling into Syria.
M. Durozoir, the author of the Life of Volney, in the
“Biographie Universelle,” to which I am greatly indebted,
falls into a most unaccountable error in narrating
this part of our traveller’s career. According
to him, Volney had no sooner arrived in Egypt than
he shut himself up in a Coptic convent, where he
remained <i>eight months</i>, for the purpose of acquiring
the Arabic; after which he traversed the country
with more advantages than any other traveller had
hitherto enjoyed. Volney himself asserts, on the
contrary, that he resided but <i>seven months</i> in the
country; that he was prevented by obstacles which
appeared to him insurmountable from traversing
more than a very small portion of Egypt; that he
did not acquire a competent knowledge of Arabic
until he arrived in Syria, where (and not in Egypt)
he shut himself up during eight months in an Arabian
convent, in order to render himself master of the
language. M. Durozoir must have forgotten Pococke,
and Shaw, and Hasselquist, and Niebuhr and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
Bruce, every one of whom were superior in external
<i>advantages</i> to Volney, and probably understood
the language of the country better than he did previous
to his residence in Syria. It is surprising,
therefore, to find a writer of respectable name speaking
of the advantages which Volney possessed over
all preceding travellers in Egypt, arising from his
long residence and knowledge, while most of his predecessors
saw ten times more of the country, enjoyed
greater privileges, and possessed a more intimate
knowledge of Arabic. The real advantage
which Volney actually did possess over the majority
of Egyptian travellers consisted in his superior genius,
which enabled him to turn his short experience
to good account, and to comprehend the meanings
of things which thousands had seen without comprehending
at all.</p>

<p>The mode in which Volney has given the results
of his travels to the public precludes the possibility
of our following his track. He sedulously avoids,
as Daru has justly remarked, placing himself upon
the stage, and neither tells you by what route he
travelled through the country, nor what were the
impressions which the sight of certain objects produced
upon his mind. The fact must be admitted,
whether it make for or against the author; but when
the count proceeds to inform us, in his inflated rhetorical
style, that the traveller is suddenly transformed
into a native of the country, who, after mature
observation, describes its physical, political,
and moral condition, we smile at his boyish enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I cannot help regretting, however, that our traveller
should have omitted to trace his route through
Egypt, not only because his having done so would
have been advantageous to me, but from a persuasion
that the omission has been seriously injurious
to his popularity. It is, moreover, a very great
error, and one in which I myself formerly participated,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
to imagine that a traveller is more likely to
impart just notions of the scene of his researches by
giving the results only of his experience, suppressing
the manner in which that experience was obtained.
An attentive examination of the works of
travellers of all ages and countries has at length created
a contrary conviction in my mind. In a judicious
personal narrative the traveller is but one
interlocutor in a drama exhibiting innumerable characters
and a perpetually changing scene. You in
some sort behold him surrounded by strangers in a
strange land; you observe them not, and hear them,
as it were, converse together; and if the traveller
himself sometimes feigns or walks in masquerade, it
is rarely that the natives can be supposed to have
sufficiently powerful motives for so doing. They
exhibit themselves exactly as they are. It would
seem to follow from this view of the case, that whatever
its advantages in other respects may be, the
method adopted by Volney is liable, on the grounds
above stated, to very serious objections. It not only
shuts out the traveller from our view, but, in lieu of
an animated picture, presents us with reasoning and
discussion, able, I admit, and frequently original, but
wanting that irresistible charm which is possessed
in so eminent a degree by beautiful narrative.</p>

<p>Having examined such objects of curiosity in
Lower Egypt as could easily be viewed, and collected
ample materials for the defence of Herodotus,
the greatest traveller of all antiquity, from the attacks
of conceited and ignorant persons, Volney
passed into Syria. “Here,” he observes, “eight
months’ residence among the Druses, in an Arabian
convent, rendered the Arabic familiar to me, and
enabled me to travel through all Syria during a
whole year.” His long residence in the mountains
of Syria, during which he no doubt undertook numerous
little excursions in various directions, furnished
him with materials for a correct picture of the scene.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
This he has drawn with equal vigour and beauty.
“Lebanon,” says he, “which gives its name to the
whole extensive chain of the Kesraouan, and the
country of the Druses, presents us everywhere
with majestic mountains. At every step we meet
with scenes in which nature displays either beauty
or grandeur; sometimes singularity, but always
variety. When we land on the coast, the loftiness
and steep ascent of this mountainous ridge, which
seems to enclose the country, those gigantic masses
which shoot into the clouds, inspire astonishment
and awe. Should the curious traveller then climb
these summits which bound his view, the wide extended
place which he discovers becomes a fresh
subject of admiration; but completely to enjoy this
majestic scene, he must ascend the very point of
Lebanon, or the Sannia. There on every side he
will view a horizon without bounds; while in clear
weather the sight is lost over the desert, which extends
to the Persian Gulf, and over the sea, which
bathes the coasts of Europe. He seems to command
the whole world, while the wandering eye,
now surveying the successive chains of mountains,
transports the imagination in an instant from Antioch
to Jerusalem, and now approaching the surrounding
objects, observes the distant profundity of the coast,
till the attention, at length, fixed by distinctive objects,
more minutely examines the rocks, woods,
torrents, hillsides, villages, and towns; and the mind
secretly exults at the diminution of things which before
appeared so great. He contemplates the valley
obscured by stormy clouds with a novel delight; and
smiles at hearing the thunder, which had so often
burst over his head, growling under his feet, while
the threatening summits of the mountains are diminished
till they appear only like the furrows of a
ploughed field, or the steps of an amphitheatre; and
he feels himself flattered by an elevation above so
many great objects on which pride makes him look
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
down with a secret satisfaction. When the traveller
visits the interior parts of these mountains, the ruggedness
of the roads, the steepness of the descents,
the height of the precipices, strike him at first with
terror, but the sagacity of his mule soon relieves
him, and he examines at his ease those picturesque
scenes which succeed each other to entertain him.
There, as in the Alps, he travels whole days to reach
a place that was in sight at his departure: he winds,
he descends, he skirts the hills, he climbs; and in
this perpetual change of position it seems as if some
magic power varied for him at every step the decorations
of the scenery. Sometimes he sees villages
ready to glide from the steep declivities on which
they are built, and so disposed, that the terraces of
one row of houses serve as a street to the row
above them. Sometimes he sees a convent standing
on a solitary eminence, like Mar-shaya in the
valley of the Tigris. Here is a rock perforated by
a torrent, and become a natural arch, like that of
Nahr-el-Leben. There another rock, worn perpendicular,
resembles a lofty wall.”</p>

<p>The same difficulty of tracing the footsteps of our
traveller of which I complained when speaking of
his Egyptian journey occurs again in Syria. It is,
in fact, impossible to discover from his works any
particulars, excepting a few dates, which are perfectly
unimportant. After a protracted residence at
the convent of Mar-hanna, or “St. John,” where, as
already observed, he matured his knowledge of
Arabic, he descended into the lower districts, and
visited a Bedouin camp, near Gaza, where he remained
several days. I know not whether it was
upon this or on some other occasion that he so far
recommended himself to the chief of a tribe by his
agreeable manners, as to inspire in the Arabs a desire
to retain him among them. Having remarked
that the Bedouins enjoy an extraordinary freedom
from religious prejudices, and are consequently disposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
to be tolerant, he adds, “Nothing can better
describe, or be a more satisfactory proof of this,
than a dialogue which one day passed between myself
and one of their sheïkhs, named Ahmed, son of
Bahir, chief of the tribe of Wahidia. ‘Why,’ said
this sheïkh to me, ‘do you wish to return among the
Franks? Since you have no aversion to our manners,
since you know how to use the lance and
manage a horse like a Bedouin, stay among us. We
will give you pelisses, a tent, a virtuous and young
Bedouin girl, and a good blood mare. You shall
live in our house.’&mdash;‘But do you not know,’ said I,
‘that, born among the Franks, I have been educated
in their religion? In what light will the Arabs view
an infidel, or what will they think of an apostate?’&mdash;‘And
do you not yourself perceive,’ said he, ‘that
the Arabs live without troubling themselves either
about the prophet, or the <i>Book</i> (the Koran)? Every
man with us follows the dictates of his conscience.
Men have a right to judge of actions, but religion
must be left to God alone.’ Another sheïkh, conversing
with me one day, addressed me, by mistake,
in the customary formulary, ‘Listen, and pray for
the prophet.’ Instead of the usual answer, <i>I have
prayed</i>, I replied with a smile, ‘<i>I listen</i>.’ He recollected
his error, and smiled in his turn. A Turk of
Jerusalem who was present took the matter up more
seriously: ‘O sheïkh,’ said he, ‘how canst thou address
the words of the true believers to an infidel?’&mdash;‘The
tongue is <i>light</i>;’ replied the sheïkh, ‘let but
the heart be <i>white</i> (pure); but you who know the
customs of the Arabs, how can you offend a stranger,
with whom we have eaten bread and salt?’ Then,
turning to me, ‘All those tribes of Frankestan, of
whom you told me that they follow not the law of
the prophet, are they more numerous than the Mussulmans?’&mdash;‘It
is thought,’ answered I, ‘that they are
five or six times more numerous, even including the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
Arabs.’&mdash;‘God is just,’ returned he; ‘he will weigh
them in his balance.’”</p>

<p>The most singular people, however, who came
under the observation of Volney during his eastern
travels, were unquestionably the Druses. Extraordinary
stories respecting their origin and manners
had from time to time prevailed in Europe. By
some they were supposed to be the descendants of
the crusaders, particularly of the English; others
attributed to them a different origin; but all agreed
in accusing them of believing in strange absurd
dogmas, and of practising monstrous rites. At
length he obtained from oriental writers the following
account of the rise of this remarkable sect. In
the year of the Hegira 386 (A. D. 996) the third
calif of the race of the Fatimites, called Hakem-b’amr-ellah,
succeeded to the throne of Egypt, at
the age of eleven years. He was one of the most
extraordinary princes of whom history has preserved
the memory. He caused the first calif, the
companion of Mahomet, to be cursed in the mosques,
and afterward revoked the anathema. He compelled
the Jews and Christians to abjure their religion,
and then permitted them to resume it. He
prohibited the making slippers for women, to prevent
their coming out of their houses. He burnt one-half
of the city of Cairo for his diversion, while his
soldiers pillaged the other. Not content with these
extravagant actions, he forbade the pilgrimage to
Mecca, fasting, and the five prayers; and at length
carried his madness so far, as to desire to pass for
God himself. He ordered a register of those who
acknowledged him to be so; and the number
amounted to sixteen thousand. This impious pretension
was supported by a false prophet, who came
from Persia into Egypt; which impostor, named
Mohammed-ben-Ismael, taught that it was not necessary
to fast or pray, to practise circumcision, to
make the pilgrimage to Mecca, or observe festivals;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
that the prohibition of pork and wine was absurd;
and that marriage between brothers and sisters,
fathers and children, was lawful. To ingratiate
himself with Hakem, he maintained that this calif
was God himself incarnate, and instead of his name
being <i>Hakem-b’amr-ellah</i>, which signifies governing
by the order of God, he called him <i>Hakem-b’amr-eh</i>,
governing by his own order. Unluckily for the
prophet, his god had not the power to protect him
from the fury of his enemies, who slew him in a
tumult, almost in the arms of the calif, who was
himself massacred soon after on Mount Mokattam,
where he, as he said, had held conversation with
angels. The death of these two chiefs did not prevent
the progress of their opinions: a disciple of
Mohammed-ben-Ismael, named Hamzaben-Ahmud,
propagated them with indefatigable zeal, in Egypt,
in Palestine, and along the coast of Syria, as far as
Sidon and Berytus. His proselytes, it seems, underwent
the same fate as the Maronites; for being persecuted
by the sect in power, they took refuge in
the mountains of Lebanon, where they were better
able to defend themselves; at least it is certain, that
shortly after this era we find them established
there, and forming an independent society like their
neighbours.</p>

<p>In the opinion of Volney the great body of the
Druses are wholly destitute of religion; “yet,”
says he, “one class of them must be excepted,
whose religious customs are very peculiar. Those
who compose it are to the rest of the nation what
the <i>initiated</i> are to the <i>profane</i>; they assume the
name of Okkals, which means spiritualists; and bestow
on the vulgar the epithet Djahel, or ignorant;
they have various degrees of initiation, the highest
orders of which require celibacy. These are distinguishable
by the white turban they affect to wear,
as a symbol of their purity; and so proud are they
of this supposed purity, that they think themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
sullied by even touching a profane person. If you
eat out of their plate, or drink out of their cup, they
break them; and hence the custom so general in
this country, of using vases with a sort of cock,
which may be drunk out of without touching the
lips. All their practices are enveloped in mysteries.
Their oratories always stand alone, and are constantly
situated on eminences: in these they hold
their secret assemblies, to which women are admitted.
It is pretended they perform ceremonies
there in presence of a small statue resembling an
ox or a calf; whence some have pretended to prove
that they are descended from the Samaritans. But,
besides that the fact is not well ascertained, the
worship of the ox may be deduced from other circumstances.</p>

<p>“They have one or two books which they conceal
with the greatest care, but chance has deceived their
jealousy; for, in a civil war, which happened six or
seven years ago, the Emir Yousef, who is <i>Djahel</i>,
or ignorant, found one among the pillage of their
oratories. I am assured by persons who have read
it, that it contains only a mystic jargon, the obscurity
of which doubtless renders it valuable to adepts.
Hakem-b’amr-ellah is there spoken of, by whom they
mean God, incarnated in the person of the calif. It
likewise treats of another life, of a place of punishment
and a place of happiness, where the Okkals
shall of course be most distinguished. Several
degrees of perfection are mentioned, to which they
arrive by successive trials. In other respects these
sectaries have all the insolence and all the fears of
superstition: they are not communicative, because
they are weak; but it is probable that, were they
powerful, they would be promulgators and intolerant.”</p>

<p>On returning to France after an absence of nearly
three years (which M. Durozoir, who loves to differ
with the traveller upon such points, will have to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
nearly <i>four years</i>), Volney employed himself in preparing
his “Travels” for the press. Upon the appearance
of the work the public, which is seldom
in the wrong in such matters, received it as a masterpiece
of its kind; and from that time to the present
its reputation may be said to be on the increase.
I am averse from adopting the unmeaning or exaggerated
panegyrics of his French biographers, who
are satisfied with nothing short of regarding Volney
as the continuator of Herodotus, with whom they
seem to consider him upon a par. No person can
be more desirous than myself to enhance the just
praises of Volney, who has exhibited, in his description
of Syria and Egypt, remarkable force and depth
of thinking, and powers of delineation of no ordinary
class. But in Herodotus we have a picture of
the whole world, as far, at least, as it was known
in his time, sketched with inimitable truth and
brevity, and adorned with a splendour of colouring
which with matchless skill he has known how to
unite with the severest accuracy. To many of the
excellences of this writer Volney has no pretensions.
Others he may have possessed in an equal degree;
but I will not continue a comparison in itself absurd,
never dreamed of by the traveller himself, and
which could only have suggested itself to writers
blinded by national vanity.</p>

<p>To proceed, however, with the events of our traveller’s
life. No sooner had the travels appeared,
than the Empress Catherine II., who, besides her
desire to wheedle every writer of distinction in
Europe, was really actuated by an admiration for
genius, sent him a gold medal in token of her satisfaction.
This was in the year 1787. In the following
year he published his “Considerations on the
War between the Turks and Russians.” In this
political pamphlet the knowledge which he had acquired
in his travels was of course the basis of his
reasoning; but he had likewise received, perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
from the Russian court, information which would appear
to have been correct, respecting the resources
of the Scythians; for events, says his French biographer
with a kind of triumph, have realized nearly
all his predictions. He did not, continues the same
writer, forget, in the consideration of this great
quarrel, the interests of France, and dwelt more
particularly on the project of seizing upon Egypt, in
order to counterbalance the aggrandizement of Russia
and Austria. But to the execution of this project
he foresaw numerous obstacles. “In the first
place,” said he, “it will be necessary to maintain
three separate wars: the first against Turkey, the
second against the English, and a third against the
natives of Egypt, which, though apparently the least
formidable, will be the most dangerous of the three.
Should the Franks venture to disembark in the
country, Turks, Arabs, and peasants would all arm
against them at once: and fanaticism would serve
them instead of art and courage.”</p>

<p>From the period of his return into his country,
being actuated by the desire of being useful, which
seems to have been ever predominant in his mind,
though it did not always manifest itself in a rational
way, Volney conceived the idea of introducing improvements
in agriculture in the island of Corsica.
For this purpose he began to concert measures for
purchasing an estate in that island, on which he
meant to make several experiments in the culture
of the sugar-cane, cotton, indigo, coffee, &amp;c. The
utility of these schemes induced the French government
to nominate him Director of Agriculture and
Commerce in Corsica; but other duties retained him
in his country. Upon the convocation of the States
General in 1789, he was elected deputy for the seneschalship
of Anjou. Shortly after this he resigned
the place he held under government, being persuaded
that the duties of a representative of the people,
and those of a dependant on the government, are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
incompatible. In the tribune of the Constituent
Assembly Volney advocated the same opinions
which are found in his writings. He was the declared
enemy of despotism, whether exercised by
one individual or by many; and constantly distinguished
himself by his bold and liberal advocacy of
popular rights. His intimate connexion with Cabanis,
celebrated for the extravagance of his metaphysical
opinions, frequently brought him into contact
with Mirabeau, the Catiline of the revolution. This
able improvisator, equally indifferent respecting the
<i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> in ideas as in money, in a discussion
concerning the clergy, borrowed from Volney his
well-known rhetorical flourish <i>on the window of
Charles IX.</i>, from whence that gracious monarch
amused himself with shooting at his subjects.
Twenty deputies were besieging the tribune, and
among these was Volney, who held a written discourse
in his hand. “Show me what you are going
to say,” said Mirabeau. “This is beautiful, sublime,”
he exclaimed, after having glanced over the
manuscript; “but it is not with a feeble voice and
a clear countenance that such things should be
uttered. Give the manuscript to me!” Such consummate
arrogance was not to be resisted. Volney
yielded up his speech to the audacious sophist, who,
melting up our traveller’s original ideas with his
own, poured out the whole with that artificial theatrical
enthusiasm which produces upon inexperienced
minds nearly the same effects as eloquence.
It is said that Volney ere long began to perceive
that the storm which had been raised with so much
labour and artifice was likely to sweep away in its
fury much more than was intended; and that he
then began to think of moderating its rage. But if
he was in earnest in his opposition, he very quickly
had the mortification to discover that his efforts
were futile; that revolution had, in fact, become a
general movement, which bore down with irresistible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
violence every obstacle which might be opposed to
it, whether by friends or foes.</p>

<p>In the midst of these political labours Volney
found time to produce two works of very different
character and pretensions: “The Chronology of the
Twelve Centuries preceding the Invasion of Greece
by Xerxes,” and his well-known rhapsody called the
“Ruins.” Shortly after this, the Empress Catherine,
who found that she had been made the dupe of
the French sophists, declared herself the enemy of
France; upon which Volney, eager to display his
contempt for his fickle admirer, returned the medal
which she had formerly presented to him. Upon
this, Grimm, the literary gladiator of the empress,
and up to that moment the friend of Volney, addressed
him a letter filled with the most biting sarcasms
and unjust personalities, but written in so
keen a style that it has been attributed to Rivarol,
another clever advocate of ancient abuses.</p>

<p>In 1792 Volney accompanied Pozzo di Borgo to
Corsica, with his old design of making agricultural
experiments. He accordingly purchased the estate
of La Confina, near Ajaccio, and was proceeding to
realize some of his useful plans, when he was driven
from the island by the troubles excited by Pascal
Paoli, who sold his estate by auction, notwithstanding
that he had recently given him various assurances
of friendship. During his residence in Corsica our
traveller became acquainted with Napoleon, who
was at that time only an officer of artillery. He is
said to have divined the character of this ambitious
man from the first; and some years later, upon
learning in America that Napoleon had been appointed
commander of the army of Italy, he remarked
to several French refugees, “Provided that
circumstances second him, he will be found to possess
the head of Cæsar on the shoulders of Alexander.”
This oracular saying, which is by no means
the best thing of the kind attributed to our traveller,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
is remarkable merely for the pomposity of the expression,
and signifies little or nothing, except that
Napoleon was as able as he was ambitious. On his
return to France, in 1793, he published a “Sketch
of the State of Corsica,” and the “Law of Nature,”
the latter of which M. Durozoir, with characteristic
exaggeration, pronounces to be “one of the best
treatises on morals which have ever been published
in any language.” The “Law of Nature” is well
known in England, and proves its writer to have
been a man of an acute and vigorous mind, as well
as an accomplished master of style; but it would be
paying Volney an absurd compliment to place his
little catechism, in which there are no ideas absolutely
new, on a level with the “Ethics to Nichomachus,”
or the great work of Panætius, of which
we may form a tolerably clear conception from the
“De Officiis” of Cicero, which is little more than a
copy of it. Moreover, in the “Law of Nature,” man
is considered too much in a material, and too little
in a spiritual light; which, though it may be a merit
in the eyes of such a writer as M. Durozoir, must
to a person of a different creed appear to be a very
remarkable defect. Considering the question merely
in a philosophical point of view, it can, I think, admit
of no dispute that the incentives to good actions
can never be too numerous; but Volney, from
his peculiar notions, could only speak of morals as
of physical science, which, taken as a whole, it certainly
is not. Whatever merit this little tract may
possess, therefore, it seems to be essentially defective
in attributing to one set of principles effects
which they never produce unless in combination
with others.</p>

<p>In 1793 our traveller, whose political opinions
were purely republican, was imprisoned ten months
as a <i>royalist</i>, and only recovered his liberty after the
events of the 9th of Thermidor. To console him in
some degree for this injustice, he was shortly afterward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
appointed historical professor in the Normal
School, which had just then been established by the
friends of order and of their country. Volney was
eminently well qualified to shine in this capacity.
His reading, which was immense, had lain much, if
not chiefly, among historical writers; and his calm,
penetrating genius enabled him to discover with extraordinary
precision the natural chain of events.
Nevertheless, from a passion for vain paradox, which
has of late been but too common both in France and
Germany among persons who would be thought to
be philosophers, he unfortunately exhibited in his
historical researches a degree of skepticism highly
absurd. He had perhaps read and admired the
startling proposition of Aristotle, that doubt is the
foundation of all science; but if doubt eternally
generate doubt, upon what basis are the sciences to
be erected? The Greek philosopher, I conceive,
merely intends to say, that without doubt there can
be no inquiry, and without inquiry no science. However,
notwithstanding this radical defect, Volney’s
lectures at the Normal School were received with
applause, principally perhaps from the striking originality
of the author’s style, and the novelty of his
views. Truths long and familiarly known, appear
to lose their beauty, and are eagerly exchanged for
errors, tricked out in all the dazzling gloss of novelty.</p>

<p>His oratorical career was not of long duration.
The Normal School was quickly suppressed; and
Volney, disgusted and fatigued with fruitless endeavours
to benefit his country, determined on deserting
it for ever, and seeking in the New World that
tranquillity which he had failed to find in the Old.
On his arrival in the United States of America, in
1795, he was well received by Washington, who
gave him many public marks of his confidence and
friendship. It is said, however, though I know not
upon what grounds, that John Adams, elected president
in 1797, entertained feelings highly inimical to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Volney, who, a short time before, had criticised severely,
perhaps unjustly, his “Defence of the Constitutions
of the United States.” It is even insinuated
by Durozoir, whose unsupported testimony I should,
however, refuse to accept in a matter of this kind,
that our traveller was driven from America by the unmanly
revenge of John Adams in the spring of 1798.
Be this as it may, he was suspected by the Americans
of being engaged in a conspiracy for delivering up
Louisiana to the Directory; while in France, on the
other hand, he was accused of having asserted that
Louisiana could never become an advantageous possession
of the French republic. While his mind was
thus harassed by contradictory and absurd suspicions,
Dr. Priestley published his “Observations
on the Progress of Infidelity,” &amp;c., in which Volney,
says Durozoir, who probably had no more read
Priestley’s pamphlet than I have, was denounced as
an “atheist, an ignoramus, a Chinese, and a Hottentot.”
Priestley was no doubt a rough polemic,
too much addicted, perhaps, to hard names; but the
work which he denounced had, in many respects, a
highly mischievous tendency, and in refuting it some
degree of warmth was pardonable.</p>

<p>On our traveller’s return to France, where he had
been elected a member of the Institute during his
absence, he became once more intimately connected
with Napoleon, whom, in 1794, he had dissuaded
from seeking military employment in Turkey or
Russia, and by his influence caused to be restored
to his rank in the army. Napoleon was not ungrateful,
and when elected to the consulate was desirous
of naming Volney his colleague. This dignity, however,
the traveller refused, as well as that of minister
of the interior, which was soon afterward offered
him. He was content with the mere rank of senator.
When at a future period Napoleon was about
to assume the title of emperor, Volney ventured to
oppose him, observing that <i>it were better to restore the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
Bourbons</i>. From this time forward he was invariably
found among that small minority in the senate
who condemned and opposed the despotic measures
of the emperor; yet he allowed himself to be decorated
with the rank of count, and the title of commandant
of the Legion of Honour. Still he took
little share in political matters, preferring before all
distinctions retirement and study.</p>

<p>In 1803 appeared his “Description of the Climate
and Soil of the United States,” a work possessing,
no doubt, considerable merit, but which has been far
from obtaining equal success with his “Eastern
Travels.” He now resumed his chronological studies,
which had been for some time interrupted. In these
he gave vent to all his heterodox opinions, which it
could answer no good purpose either to retail or refute
in this place. Others, more deeply versed than
I in the chronology of the world, have performed
this task; which was not, however, extremely necessary,
as Volney’s labours on this subject seem
designed never to acquire popularity. In 1810 he
married Mademoiselle Chassebœuf, his cousin, for
whose amusement he purchased a large mansion,
with extensive gardens, &amp;c., in the Rue Vaugirard.
Here he lived in a kind of morose and misanthropic
retirement, heightened, if not caused, by his gloomy
and unhappy opinions; and here he died, on the
25th of April, 1820, in the sixty-third year of his
age.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EDWARD_DANIEL_CLARKE">EDWARD DANIEL CLARKE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">Born 1769.&mdash;Died 1822.</p>

<p>Edward Daniel Clarke was born on the 5th of
June, 1769, at Willingdon, in the county of Sussex.
Even when a child he is said to have displayed great
narrative powers, which he exercised as frequently
as possible for the amusement of his father’s domestics
and parishioners. In his boyish studies,
however, he was wanting in application; a fault
arising from the quickness and vivacity of his mind,
actuated by insatiable curiosity, and characterized
from the beginning by a decided partiality for natural
history. Still, the loss sustained by this species
of negligence he afterward severely felt, when,
notwithstanding the habits of industry which he acquired
at a later period of youth, it was found impossible
by any degree of exertion to retrieve the
moments misspent or wasted in boyhood. At the
same time there was one advantage derived from
his unstudious inclinations; they urged him to be
much abroad in the open air, where he amused himself
with running, leaping, and swimming, in which
last accomplishment he was particularly skilled, and
on one occasion had the satisfaction of saving by
this means the life of his younger brother, who was
seized by the cramp while bathing in the moat
which surrounded his father’s house.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1786, through the kindness of Dr.
Beadon, afterward Bishop of Bath and Wells, Clarke
obtained the office of chapel clerk at Jesus College,
Cambridge, whither he removed about the Easter
of the above year. Next year he sustained the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
heavy calamity to lose a pious, beneficent, affectionate
father, by which misfortune, young and inexperienced
as he was, without a profession, and with
few prospects of advancement, he was entirely
thrown upon his own resources, his remaining parent
not possessing the means of aiding him with aught
beyond her prayers. Fortunately his deceased
father had, instead of wealth, bequeathed to his
family a more valuable inheritance; a name revered
for sanctity, and a number of noble-minded friends,
who not only provided for the immediate necessities
of its several members, but continued to watch
over their progress, and on many important occasions
to advance their interests in after-life. Nevertheless,
Clarke had to contend with numerous difficulties.
“Soon after the death of their father,”
says Mr. Otter, “the two elder sons returned to college;
and Edward, having now acquired a melancholy
title to one of the scholarships of the society
of Jesus College, founded by Sir Tobias Rustat, for
the benefit of clergymen’s orphans, was elected a
scholar on this foundation immediately upon his return.
The emoluments of his scholarship, joined to
those of an exhibition from Tunbridge school, and
the profits of his chapel clerk’s place, amounting in
the whole to less than 90<i>l.</i> a year, were his principal,
indeed it is believed his only resources during
his residence at college; and, however well they
may have been husbanded, it must be evident that,
even in those times of comparative moderation in
expense, they could not have been sufficient for his
support, especially when it is understood that he was
naturally liberal to a fault. It does not appear, however,
that he derived during this time any pecuniary
assistance from his father’s friends; and as there is
the strongest reason to believe that he faithfully adhered
to the promise he had made to his mother,
that he would never draw upon her slender resources
for his support, it may excite some curiosity to know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
by what means the deficiency was supplied. The
fact is, that he was materially assisted in providing
for his college expenses by the liberality of his tutor,
Mr. Plampin, who, being acquainted with his circumstances,
suffered his bills to remain in arrear; and
they were afterward discharged from the first profits
he derived from his private pupils.”</p>

<p>The indolent inactivity which had marked his
school studies did not desert him at college. He
seems, in fact, to have been disgusted with the system
of education pursued at Cambridge, caring nothing
for mathematics, which were there regarded
as all in all, and finding among the other mental pursuits
of the place nothing whatever to kindle the ardour
of his ambitious mind. Still the desire of fame,
without which man never performed any thing great,
began gradually to manifest itself in his character
both to himself and others. Exceedingly uncertain
as to the mode, he yet determined to acquire in one
way or another a reputation in literature; and while
many of those around him were descanting complacently
upon his failings, and the consequent backwardness
of his acquirements, he silently felt the
sting which was so soon to goad him on to a destiny
more brilliant than his compassionate comrades ever
dreamed of. His favourite studies, however, such
as they were, he seems to have pursued with considerable
eagerness; and by degrees his taste, after
wavering for some time, settled definitively on
literature.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1790 Clarke obtained, through the
recommendation of Dr. Beadon, then Bishop of
Gloucester, the office of private tutor to the honourable
Henry Tufton, nephew to the Duke of Dorset.
The place selected for his residence with his pupil,
says Mr. Otter, was a large house belonging to Lord
Thanet, inhabited at that time only by one or two
servants, situated in a wild and secluded part of the
county of Kent, and cut off, as well by distance as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
bad roads, from all cheerful and improving society;
a residence suitable enough to a nobleman with a
large establishment and a wide circle of friends, but
the last place, one would have thought, to improve
and polish a young man of family just entering into
active life. His pupil, moreover, had conceived a
dislike for study and for tutors of every kind, which
promised to enhance the tedium of a life spent in
such a scene. But Clarke, who probably sympathized
with the young man’s aversion from intellectual
task-work, very quickly succeeded by his gay,
lively, insinuating manners in winning his confidence,
and, apparently, in convincing him that a
certain degree of knowledge might be useful, even
to a man of his rank. This agreeable result, which
seems to have been somewhat unexpected, so raised
our incipient traveller in the estimation of the Duke
of Dorset, that the engagement, which appears to have
been at first for nine months only, was prolonged
another year, the latter part of which was occupied
in making with his pupil the tour of Great Britain.
Of these domestic travels he on his return published
the history; but the performance appears to have
been hastily and slovenly written, and, as has been
the fate of many other youthful works, to have been
severely judged by the mature author, jealous of his
fame, and averse from exhibiting to the public the
nakedness of his unformed mind.</p>

<p>Shortly after the conclusion of this tour he accompanied
his pupil in a little excursion to Calais,
when he enjoyed the satisfaction, which none but a
traveller can appreciate, of treading for the first time
on foreign ground. In 1792 he was fortunate enough
to obtain an engagement to travel with Lord Berwick,
whom he had known at college, and in the
autumn of that year set out in company with that
young nobleman, through Germany and Switzerland
into Italy. He was now in the position for which
nature had originally designed him. “An unbounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
love of travel,” says he, “influenced me at a very
early period of my life. It was conceived in infancy,
and I shall carry it with me to the grave. When I
reflect upon the speculations of my youth, I am at a
loss to account for a passion which, predominating
over every motive of interest and every tie of affection,
urges me to press forward and to pursue inquiry,
even in the bosoms of the ocean and the
desert. Sometimes, in the dreams of fancy, I am
weak enough to imagine that the map of the world
was painted in the awning of my cradle, and that
my nurse chanted the wanderings of pilgrims in her
legendary lullabies.” This was the spirit which
urged the Marco Polos, the Chardins, and the Bruces
to undertake their illustrious journeys; and if Clarke
was compelled by circumstances to confine his researches
to less remote and better known countries,
he exhibited in his rambles through these a kindred
enthusiasm, and similar devotion and energy.</p>

<p>Clarke and his companion having passed the Alps,
which, however frequently seen, still maintain their
rank among the most sublime objects in nature, descended
into Italy, visited Turin and Rome, and then
proceeded to Naples, in which city and its environs
they remained nearly two years. In the summer of
1793 there was, as is well known, an eruption of
Mount Vesuvius, which our traveller, now an inhabitant
of Naples, enjoyed ample opportunities of
visiting. And here a striking manifestation of the
daring intrepidity of the English occurred: for not
only Clarke himself, part of whose business as a
traveller it was to familiarize himself with danger,
but numbers of other English gentlemen, and even
ladies, ascended to the mouth of the burning crater
and the sources of lava-streams in an active state
for mere amusement; where, on one occasion, a
lady narrowly escaped death from a large stone from
the volcano, which flew by her like a wheel. At
another time the whole party were menaced with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
the fate of the elder Pliny. It was in the month of
February. “I found the crater in a very active state,”
says Clarke, “throwing out volleys of immense
stones transparent with vitrification, and such
showers of ashes involved in thick sulphurous
clouds as rendered any approach to it extremely
dangerous. We ascended as near as possible, and
then crossing over to the lava attempted to coast it
up to its source. This we soon found was impossible,
for an unfortunate wind blew all the smoke of
the lava hot upon us, attended at the same time with
such a thick mist of minute ashes from the crater,
and such fumes of sulphur, that we were in danger
of being suffocated. In this perplexity I had recourse
to an expedient recommended by Sir W.
Hamilton, and proposed immediately crossing the
current of liquid lava to gain the windward side of
it; but felt some fears, owing to the very liquid appearance
the lava there had so near its source. All
my companions were against the scheme, and while
we stood deliberating, immense fragments of stone
and huge volcanic bombs that had been cast out by
the crater, but which the smoke had prevented us
from observing, fell thick about us, and rolled by
with a velocity that would have crushed any of us,
had we been in the way. I found we must either
leave our present spot, or expect instant death;
therefore, covering my face with my hat, I rushed
upon the lava and crossed over safely to the other
side, having my boots only a little burnt and my
hands scorched. Not one of my companions, however,
would stir, nor could any persuasion of mine
avail in getting a single guide over to me. I then
saw clearly the whole of the scene, and expected
my friends would every moment be sacrificed to
their own imprudence and want of courage, as the
stones from the crater fell continually around them,
and vast rocks of lava bounded by them with great
force. At last I had the satisfaction of seeing them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
retire, leaving me entirely alone. I begged hard for
a torch to be thrown over to me, that I might not be
lost when the night came on. It was then that André,
one of the ciceroni of Resina, after being promised
a bribe, ran over to me, and brought with him a bottle
of wine and a torch. We had coasted the lava, ascending
for some time, when looking back I perceived
my companions endeavouring to cross the
lava lower down, where the stream was narrower.
In doing this they found themselves insulated, as it
were, and surrounded by two different rivers of liquid
fire. They immediately pressed forward, being terribly
scorched by both currents, and ran to the side
where I was; in doing which one of the guides fell
into the middle of the red-hot lava, but met with no
other injury than having his hands and face burnt,
and losing at the same time a bottle of vin de grave,
which was broken in the fall, and which proved a
very unpleasant loss to us, being ready to faint with
excessive thirst, fatigue, and heat. Having once
more rallied my forces, I proceeded on, and in about
half an hour I gained the chasm through which the
lava had opened itself a passage out of the mountain.
To describe this sight is utterly beyond all
human ability. My companions, who were with me
then, shared in the astonishment it produced; and
the sensations they felt in concert with me were
such as can be obliterated only with our lives. All
I had seen of volcanic phenomena before did not
lead me to expect such a spectacle as I then beheld.
I had seen the vast rivers of lava which descended
into the plains below, and carried ruin and devastation
with them; but they resembled a vast heap of
cinders on the scoriæ of an iron foundry, rolling
slowly along, and falling with a rattling noise over
one another. Here a vast arched chasm presented
itself in the side of the mountain, from which rushed
with the velocity of a flood the clear vivid torrent
of lava in perfect fusion, and totally unconnected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
with any other matter that was not in a state of complete
solution, unattended by any scoriæ on its surface,
or gross materials of an insolvent nature; but
flowing with the translucency of honey, in regular
channels cut finer than art can imitate, and glowing
with all the splendour of the sun.”</p>

<p>In the July of the same year our traveller viewed
Vesuvius under another aspect, when soft, tranquil
beauty had succeeded to terrific sublimity. “While
we were at tea in the Albergo Reale,” says he,
“such a scene presented itself as every one agreed
was beyond any thing of that kind they had ever
seen before. It was caused by the moon, which
suddenly rose behind the convent on Vesuvius; at
first a small bright line silvering all the clouds, and
then a full orb which threw a blaze of light across
the sea, through which the vessels passed and re-passed
in a most beautiful manner. At the same
time the lava, of a different hue, spread its warm tint
upon all the objects near it, and threw a red line
across the bay, directly parallel to the reflection of
the moon’s rays. It was one of those scenes which
one dwells upon with regret, because one feels the
impossibility of retaining the impression it affords.
It remains in the memory, but then all its outlines
and its colours are so faintly touched, that the beauty
of the spectacle fades away with the landscape;
which, when covered by the clouds of the night, and
veiled in darkness, can never be revived by the pencil,
the pen, or by any recourse to the traces it has
left upon the mind.”</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1793 Clarke received from Lord
Berwick a proposal that he should accompany him
to Egypt and the Holy Land, with which our traveller,
whose secret wishes had long pointed that
way, immediately closed. While preparations were
making for the journey, Lord Berwick suddenly
recollected that some living, to which he was to
present his brother, might fall vacant during his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
absence, and be lost to his family. He determined,
therefore, on sending an express to England; and
when he had hired his courier, Clarke, who perhaps
felt the want of violent exercise, offered to accompany
the man, that no time might be lost. He accordingly
set out for England, and having remained
two or three days in London to execute the commission
with which he had been intrusted, he hurried
down to Shropshire, and arranged the business
which had brought him to England. This being accomplished,
he returned to London, where, to his
infinite surprise and mortification, he found a letter
from Lord Berwick, informing him that the expedition
to Egypt had been postponed or abandoned.
His engagement with this nobleman, however, had
not yet expired. He therefore, after a short stay in
England, hastened back to Italy, from whence he
finally returned in the summer of 1794.</p>

<p>Clarke now spent some time with his mother and
family at Uckfield, and in the autumn of the same
year undertook, at the recommendation of the
Bishop of St. Asaph, the care of Sir Thomas Mostyn,
a youth of about seventeen. This engagement
continued about a year, during which period he resided
with his pupil in Wales, where he became
known to Pennant, with whom he afterward maintained
a correspondence. When this connexion had,
from some unexplained causes, ceased to exist, our
traveller undertook a small periodical work called
“Le Rêveur,” which, when twenty-nine numbers
had been published without success, was judiciously
discontinued, and sunk so completely into oblivion
that not a single copy, it is believed, could now be
found.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1796 Clarke entered into an engagement
with the family of Lord Uxbridge, which,
under whatever auspices begun, was highly beneficial
to himself and satisfactory to his employers.
The youth first placed under his care, delicate and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
feeble in constitution, soon fell a prey to disease;
but the next youngest son of the family, the honourable
Berkeley Paget, succeeded his brother; and
with him, in the summer and autumn of 1797, our
traveller made the tour of Scotland. This was in
every respect an agreeable and fortunate journey for
our traveller, who not only enjoyed the scenery,
wild, varied, and beautiful, which the north of England
and many parts of Scotland afford, but secured
in his pupil a powerful friend, who, so long as our
traveller lived, promoted his interests, and when his
life had closed, continued the same benevolent regard
to his family.</p>

<p>On the termination of his connexion with Mr.
Paget, who was now sent to Oxford, Clarke retired
to Uckfield, where, for a time, he seemed entirely
immersed in the pleasures of field-sports. His devotion
to this species of amusement, however, was
destined to be of short duration. A young gentleman
of Sussex, whose education had been very
much neglected, succeeded about this time to a considerable
estate, upon which he intimated his desire
of placing himself for three years under the guidance
and instruction of our traveller, first at Cambridge,
and afterward during a long and extensive tour upon
the Continent. The pecuniary part of the proposal
was very liberal, says Mr. Otter, and the plan was
entered upon without delay. The traveller and his
pupil remained a whole year at Cambridge, during
which the former, who fully understood the advantages
of knowledge, and had been hitherto prevented
by his wandering life from pursuing any regular
course of study, profited quite as much as the latter.</p>

<p>The preliminary portion of their studies being
over, Clarke and his pupil began to prepare for their
travels. Two other individuals were at first associated
with them, Professor Malthus, author of the
celebrated treatise on population, and the Rev. Mr.
Otter, afterward the biographer of our traveller.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
The party set out from Cambridge on the 20th May,
1799, and arrived at Hamburgh on the 25th. Here
they made but a short stay before they set out for
Copenhagen, and from thence, by way of Stockholm,
across the whole of Sweden to Tornea, on the Gulf
of Bothnia. Malthus and Otter left them at the
Wener Lake. Clarke, with all the enthusiasm of a
genuine traveller, could never imagine he had carried
his researches sufficiently far; but, having
reached the 66th degree of northern latitude, declared
he would not return until he should have
snuffed the polar air. His pupil, Cripps, seems to
have shared largely in his locomotive propensity,
and in the courage which prompts to indulge it.
They therefore proceeded towards the polar regions
together; but having reached Enontakis, in latitude
68° 30´ 30´´ north, our traveller, who had previously
been seized by a severe fit of illness, was constrained
to abandon the polar expedition and shape his course
towards the south. Writing from Enontakis to his
mother, “We have found,” says he, “the cottage of
a priest in this remote corner of the world, and have
been snug with him a few days. Yesterday I
launched a balloon eighteen feet in height, which I had
made to attract the natives. You may guess their
astonishment when they saw it rise from the earth.</p>

<p>“Is it not famous to be here within the frigid
zone, more than two degrees within the arctic, and
nearer to the pole than the most northern shores
of Iceland? For a long time darkness has been a
stranger to us. The sun, as yet, passes not below
the horizon, but he dips his crimson visage behind a
mountain to the north. This mountain we ascended,
and had the satisfaction to see him make his
courtesy without setting. At midnight the priest
of this place lights his pipe during three weeks in
the year by means of a burning-glass from the sun’s
rays.”</p>

<p>Having, for the reason above stated, given up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
design of visiting the polar regions, they returned to
Tornea, and thence proceeded through Sweden and
Norway; which latter country (probably for the
same reason which made Pope of the opinion of the
last author he read) he preferred for sublimity of
scenery to Switzerland. They then entered Russia,
and arrived at Petersburg on the 26th of January,
1800. Clarke, it is well known, entertained a very
mean opinion of the Russians; but, judging from the
testimony of Bishop Heber&mdash;a calmer and more dispassionate
man&mdash;as well as from that of many other
travellers, it would appear that his judgment was
neither rash nor ill founded. “We have been here
five days,” says he. “Our servants were taken from
us at the frontiers, and much difficulty had we with
the Russian thieves as we came along. Long accustomed
to Swedish honesty it is difficult for us to
assume all at once a system of suspicion and
caution: the consequence of this is that they remove
all the moveables out of their way. I wish much to
like the Russians, but those who govern them will
take care I never shall. This place, were it not for
its magnificence, would be insufferable. We silently
mourn when we remember Sweden. As for our
harps there are no trees to hang them upon; nevertheless
we sit down by the waters of Babylon and
weep. They open all the letters, and therefore
there is something for them to chew upon. More
I dare not add; perhaps your experience will supply
the rest.”</p>

<p>To this, if we add his picture of the execrable
despot who then governed Russia, enough will have
been said of his experience at Petersburg. “It is
impossible,” he writes, “to say what will be the end
of things here, or whether the emperor is more of a
madman, a fool, a knave, or a tyrant. If I were to
relate the ravings, the follies, the villanies, the
cruelties of that detestable beast, I should never
reach the end of my letter. Certainly things cannot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
long go on as they do now. The other day the
soldiers by his order cudgelled a gentleman in the
street because the cock of his hat was not in a line
with his nose. He has sent the Prince of Condé’s
army to the right-about, which is hushed up, and it
is to appear that they are ceded to Great Britain.
He refuses passports even to ambassadors for their
couriers. One is not safe a moment. It is not
enough to act by rule, you must regulate your
features to the whims of a police officer. If you
frown in the street you will be taken up.”</p>

<p>From Petersburg they proceeded in sledges to
Moscow, which, like most oriental cities, seemed
all splendour from a distant view, but shrunk upon
their entering it into a miserable collection of hovels,
interspersed with a few grotesque churches and
tawdry palaces. This place, which is too well
known to require me to dwell much upon its appearance,
they quitted to proceed to the Crimea.
Arriving at Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov, Clarke
amused himself with swimming in the Don, the
ancient Tanais, between Europe and Asia, and in
thinking of the vast extent of country over which
his good fortune had already carried him, and
of the far more glorious scenes&mdash;Palestine&mdash;Egypt&mdash;Greece&mdash;which
yet lay in his route. “Do, for
God’s sake imagine,” says he in a letter to a friend,
“what I must feel in the prospect of treading the
plains of Troy!&mdash;Tears of joy stream from my eyes
while I write.” To a person of such a frame of
mind&mdash;and no others should ever leave their firesides&mdash;travelling,
next to the performance of virtuous
actions, affords the most exquisite pleasure
upon earth. The imagination, impregnated by a
classical education with glowing ideas of what
certain scenes once were, invests them with unearthly
splendour, of which no experience can ever
afterward divest them.</p>

<p>Upon their arriving at Achmedshid in the Crimea,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
they remained some time in the house of Professor
Pallas, who entertained them in so hospitable a
manner that Clarke, who spoke of men as he found
them, could not forbear imparting to his friends at
home the warm gratitude of his heart. “It is with
him we now live,” says he, “till the vessel is ready
to sail for Constantinople; and how can I express
his kindness to me? He has all the tenderness of a
father to us both. Every thing in his house he
makes our own. He received me worn down with
fatigue and ill of a tertian fever. Mrs. Pallas nursed
me, and he cured me, and then loaded me with all
sorts of presents; books, drawings, insects, plants,
minerals, &amp;c. The advantage of conversing with
such a man is worth the whole journey from England,
not considering the excellent qualities of his
heart. Here we are in quite an elegant English
house; and if you knew the comfort of lying down
in a clean bed after passing months without taking
off your clothes in deserts and among savages, you
would know the comfort we feel. The vessel is at
Kosloff, distant forty miles; and when we leave the
Crimea Mr. and Mrs. Pallas and their daughter, who
has been married since we were in the house to a
general officer, go with us to Kosloff; and will dine
with us on board the day we sail. They prepare all
our provisions for the voyage.”</p>

<p>The whole of their stay in Russia was rendered
so exceedingly disagreeable&mdash;first by the savage
tyranny of the emperor, and secondly by the evil
character of his subjects, which, as being everywhere
felt, was infinitely more annoying&mdash;that our
traveller regarded himself among a civilized and
hospitable people when he reached Constantinople.
In fact, he found himself in a sort of English society
which, congregating together at the palace of the
embassy, engaged in the same round of amusements
which would have occupied them in London. The
time which these agreeable occupations left him was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
employed in searching for and examining Greek
medals, and in viewing such curiosities as were to
be found in Constantinople; among other things the
interior of the seraglio, where no Frank, he says,
had before set his foot. He moreover found time
to peruse many of the various publications called
forth by the Bryant controversy respecting the existence
of Troy; and so unsteady was his faith on
this point, that, after dipping a little into the subject,
he began to imagine something like a new theory to
explain the manner in which we are required to believe
Homer might have invented the whole groundwork
of the Iliad! However, upon shortly afterward
arriving on the spot, this flimsy vagary
vanished. Jacob Bryant and his followers were
found to be the pettifogging skeptics which they
have always been considered by sensible men.
“The Plain of Troy now,” exclaims our traveller,
“offers every fact you want; there is nothing
doubtful. No argument will stand an instant<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
opposition to the test of inquiry upon the spot;
penetrating into the mountains behind the Acropolis
the proofs grow more numerous as you advance,
till at length the discussion becomes absurd, and the
nonsense of Bryantism so ridiculous that his warmest
partisans would be ashamed to acknowledge
they had ever assented for an instant to such contemptible
blasphemy upon the most sacred records
of history.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a>
An intaglio purchased by Clarke at Constantinople is exceedingly
remarkable, as throwing light upon the original story of Æneas, before
it had been deformed by Virgil or Ovid. “There are poor Turks at Constantinople,
whose business it is to wash the mud of the common sewers
of the city, and the sand of the shore. These people found a small onyx,
with an antique intaglio of most excellent workmanship, representing
Æneas flying from the city, leading his boy by the hand, and bearing on
his shoulders (who do you suppose?)&mdash;not his father&mdash;for in that case
the subject might have been borrowed from Virgil or Ovid&mdash;but&mdash;his
wife, with the Penates in her lap; and so wonderfully wrought that
these three figures are brought into a gem of the smallest size, and
wings are added to the feet of Æneas,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Pedibus timor addidit alas!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>to express by symbols of the most explicit nature the story and the
situation of the hero. Thus it is proved that a tradition, founded neither
on the works of Homer nor the Greek historians (and perhaps unknown
to Virgil and the Roman poets, who always borrowed their stories from
such records as were afforded by the works of ancient artists), existed
among the ancients in the remotest periods, respecting the war of Troy.
The authenticity of this invaluable little relic, the light it strews on
ancient history, its beauty, and the remarkable coincidence of the spot
on which it was found, with the locality of the subject it illustrates, interested
so much the late Swedish minister, Mr. Heidensham, and other
antiquarians of the first talents in this part of the world, that I have
given it a very considerable part of this letter, hoping it will not be indifferent
to you.”</p>

</div>

<p>From the Troad Clarke proceeded to Rhodes, the
Gulf of Glaucus, on the coast of Asia Minor, and
thence by sea to Egypt, where the English fleet was
then lying in Aboukir Bay. He did not, however,
see much of Egypt on this occasion, for the country
was still in the possession of the French; and
therefore, after a short visit to Rosetta, he sailed
for Cyprus, and on returning from this voyage proceeded
in the Romulus to Palestine. Here he
visited Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem, and the
Lake of Genesareth; near which he enjoyed an
opportunity of conversing with a party of Druses.
Almost every traveller in Syria has given us some
new particulars respecting this curious people.
“They are,” says Clarke, “the most extraordinary
people on earth; singular in the simplicity of their
lives by their strict integrity and virtue. They only
eat what they earn by their own labour, and preserve
at this moment the superstitions brought by the
Israelites out of Egypt. What will be your surprise
to learn that every Thursday they elevate the
molten calf, before which they prostrate themselves,
and having paid their adoration, each man selects
among the women present the wife he likes best,
with whom the ceremony ends. The calf is of gold,
silver, or bronze. This is exactly that worship at
which Moses was so incensed in descending from
Mount Sinai. The cow was the Venus of the
Egyptians, and of course the calf a personification
of animal desire; a Cupid before which the sacrifices
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
so offensive to Moses were held. For it is related
they set up a molten calf, which Aaron had made
from the earrings of the Israelite women; before
which similar sacrifices were made. And certainly
the Druses on Mount Lebanon are a detachment
of the posterity of those Israelites who are so often
represented in Scripture as deserters from the true
faith, falling back into the old superstitions and
pagan worship of the country from whence they
came. I could not visit Mount Lebanon; but I took
every method necessary to ascertain the truth of
this relation; and I send it you as one of the highest
antiquities and most curious relics of remote ages
which has yet been found upon earth.”</p>

<p>His stay in Palestine was exceedingly short, just
sufficient to enable him to say he had looked at it.
He then returned to Aboukir Bay, where his brother
was commander of an English ship; which now, on
the 6th of August, 1801, swarmed with French
prisoners like a beehive. When the road to Cairo
was rendered practicable by the defeat of the
French, our traveller proceeded to that city, where
the most interesting objects existing were the
beautiful young women who had been torn by the
French soldiers from the harems of the bey; and
then, when they evacuated the country, deserted
and abandoned to their fate. Here he procured a
complete copy of the “Arabian Nights,” which,
with many other works that were so many sealed
books to him, gave rise to much unavailing regret
that he had bestowed little or no attention on the
Arabic language. The Pyramids he of course
admired. “Without hyperbole,” says he, “they
are immense mountains; and when clouds cast
shadows over their white sides they are seen passing
as upon the summit of the Alps.” From the
pinnacle of the loftiest he dated one of his letters to
England, all of which are filled with lively dashing
gossip, accompanied with rash, headlong, unphilosophical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
decisions, which the reflections of a
moment, perhaps, might have served to dissipate.
The news of the capitulation of Alexandria induced
him to hurry back to the coast. He found the
French troops still in the city, but preparing to embark
with all speed. Great disputes, he says, had
already arisen between General Hutchinson and
Menou respecting the antiquities and collections of
natural history which had been made by the French;
the former claiming them as public, and the latter
refusing them as private property. The part performed
by Clarke himself in this affair he shall
relate in his own words:&mdash;“When I arrived in the
British camp, General Hutchinson informed me that
he had already stipulated for the stone in question
(the Rosetta marble), and asked me whether I
thought the other literary treasures were sufficiently
national to be included in his demands. You may
be sure I urged all the arguments I could muster to
justify the proceeding; and it is clear they are not
private property. General Hutchinson sent me to
Menou, and charged me to discover what national
property of that kind was in the hands of the
French. Hamilton, Lord Elgin’s secretary, had
gone the same morning about an hour before with
Colonel Turner of the Antiquarian Society about
the Hieroglyphic Table. I showed my pass at the
gates, and was admitted. The streets and public
places were filled with the French troops, in desperate
bad-humour. Our proposals were made known,
and backed with a menace from the British general
that he would break the capitulation if the proposals
were not acceded to. The whole corps of sçavans
and engineers beset Menou, and the poor old fellow,
what with us and them, was completely hunted.
We have been now at this work since Thursday the
11th, and I believe have succeeded. We found
much more in their possession than was suspected
or imagined. Pointers would not range better for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
game than we have done for statues, sarcophagi,
maps, MSS., drawings, plans, charts, botany, stuffed
birds, animals, dried fishes, &amp;c. Savigny, who has
been years in forming the beautiful collection of
natural history for the republic, is in despair.
Therefore we represented to General Hutchinson,
that it would be the best plan to send him to England
also, as the most proper person to take care
of the collection, and to publish its description if
necessary.”</p>

<p>No man, I suppose, who has passed beyond the
frontiers of his own country, can fail to have experienced
frequent depressions of spirit, during which
he has probably repented him of his wandering
habits. But Clarke was like a weathercock, now
pointing to the east, now to the west. In the island
of Zea, off the promontory of Sunium, he repented
heartily of having undertaken the voyage to Greece.
“Danger, fatigue, disease, filth, treachery, thirst,
hunger, storms, rocks, assassins,&mdash;these,” he exclaims,
“are the realities which a traveller in
Greece meets with!” Anon, at Athens, he writes,
“We have been here three days; we sailed into the
port of the Piræus after sunset on the 28th. The
little voyage from Cape Sunium to Athens is one
of the most interesting I ever made. The height
of the mountains brings the most distant objects
into the view, and you are surrounded by beauty
and grandeur. The sailors and pilots still give to
every thing its ancient name, with only a little difference
in the pronunciation. They show you as
you sail along, Ægina and Salamis, Mount Hymettus
and Athens, and Megara, and the mountains of
Corinth. The picture is the same as it was in the
earliest ages of Greece. The Acropolis rises to
view as if it were in its most perfect state: the
temples and buildings seem entire; for the eye, in
the Saronic Gulf, does not distinguish the injuries
which the buildings have suffered, and nature, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
course, is the same now as she was in the days of
Themistocles. I cannot tell you what sensations I
felt: the successions were so rapid I knew not
whether to laugh or to cry,&mdash;sometimes I did both.</p>

<p>“Our happiness is complete, we have forgotten
all our disasters, and I have half a mind to blot out
all I have written in the first part of this letter.
We are in the most comfortable house imaginable,
with a good widow and her daughter. You do not
know Lusieri. He was my friend in Italy many
years ago. Think what a joy to find him here,
presiding over the troop of artists, architects,
sculptors, and excavators that Lord Elgin has sent
here to work for him. He is the most celebrated
artist at present in the world. Pericles would have
deified him. He attends us everywhere, and Pausanias
himself would not have made a better cicerone.</p>

<p>“Athens exceeds all that ever has been written or
painted from it. I know not how to give an idea of
it; because, having never seen any thing like it, I
must become more familiar with so much majesty
before I can describe it. I am no longer to lament
the voyage I lost with Lord Berwick; because it is
exactly that which a man should see <i>last</i> in his travels.
It is even with joy I consider it is perhaps the
end of all my admiration. We are lucky in the
time of our being here. The popularity of the English
name gives us access to many things which
strangers before were prohibited from visiting, and
the great excavations that are going on discover
daily some hidden treasures. Rome is almost as insignificant
in comparison with Athens as London
with Rome; and one regrets the consciousness that
no probable union of circumstances will ever again
carry the effects of human labour to the degree of
perfection they have attained here.”</p>

<p>No one after this will accuse Clarke of being deficient
in enthusiasm; but this is not all. On reaching
the summit of Parnassus, he bursts forth into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
expressions of admiration, which, if they were not
justified by the sublime beauty of the scenes themselves,
or by the historical glory with which they
must be eternally associated, would be absurd. “It
is necessary to forget all that has preceded&mdash;all the
travels of my life&mdash;all I ever imagined&mdash;all I ever
saw! Asia&mdash;Egypt&mdash;the Isles&mdash;Italy&mdash;the Alps&mdash;whatever
you will! Greece surpasses all! Stupendous
in its ruins! Awful in its mountains!&mdash;captivating
in its vales&mdash;bewitching in its climate. Nothing
ever equalled it&mdash;no pen can describe it&mdash;no
pencil can portray it!</p>

<p>“I know not when we shall get to Constantinople.
We are as yet only three days’ distance from
Athens; and here we sit on the top of Parnassus, in
a little sty, full of smoke, after wandering for a
fortnight in Attica, Bœotia, and Phocis. We have
been in every spot celebrated in ancient story&mdash;in
fields of slaughter, and in groves of song. I shall
grow old in telling you the wonders of this country.
Marathon, Thebes, Platæa, Leuctra, Thespia, Mount
Helicon, the grove of the Muses, the cave of Trophonius,
Cheronea, Orchomene, Delphi, the Castalian
fountain, Parnassus; we have paid our vows
in all! But what is most remarkable, in Greece
there is hardly a spot which hath been particularly
dignified that is not also adorned by the most singular
beauties of nature. Independently of its history,
each particular object is interesting.”</p>

<p>From Athens they proceeded by land to Constantinople
through ancient Thrace, by a route partly
trodden by Pococke. After a short stay at this
city, they directed their course homewards through
Roumelia, Austria, Germany, and France, and arrived
in England after an absence of upwards of
three years. Cripps now returned for a short period
to his family, and Clarke, who had by this time
acquired an immense reputation, took up his residence
at Cambridge, where, with very few intervals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
of absence, he remained nearly twenty years.
He was very soon rejoined by his pupil, the completing
of whose education, together with the arranging
of his curiosities and antiquities, and the
composition of his travels, fully occupied his leisure
for some time. A statue of Ceres which our traveller
had dug up, and sent home from Greece, was
presented, on his return, to the university; in consequence
of which the degree of LL.D. was conferred
upon Clarke, and that of M.A. upon his companion.</p>

<p>In 1805 Dr. Clarke published a “Dissertation on
the Sarcophagus in the British Museum,” which,
though necessarily neglected by the public, is said
to have given considerable satisfaction to the learned,
and procured for its author many valuable acquaintances.
Another and a very different subject employed
his mind throughout a great part of the following
year. This was no less a thing than matrimony;
which, as soon as the idea got footing in his
brain, occupied his ardent imagination to the exclusion
of every thing else. His suit, however, was
successful. The lady of his choice became his wife;
and to increase this piece of good fortune, two livings,
for he had entered into orders, were presented
him by his friends, the one shortly before, and the
other immediately after his marriage. He now occupied
himself with lectures on mineralogy, which
were delivered at the university to crowded audiences,
and were a source of considerable profit.
This, as he expected, led to his appointment as professor
of mineralogy; and “thus,” says Mr. Otter,
“were his most sanguine wishes crowned with success;
and thus were his spirit and perseverance rewarded
with one of the rarest and highest honours
which the university could bestow.”</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke now began to think of turning the
treasures he had picked up in his travels to account;
he sold his MSS. to the Bodleian Library at Oxford
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
for 1000<i>l.</i>, and his Greek coins to Mr. Payne Knight
for 100 guineas. The publication of his travels next
followed, and produced him a clear sum of 6595<i>l.</i>
In the year 1814 his old passion for travelling revived,
and an expedition was projected into the Grecian
Archipelago for the purpose of collecting antiquities,
manuscripts, &amp;c. But he was overruled
by his friend, who probably believed that his constitution
was now unequal to the fatigue which would
be the inevitable attendant on such a mission. To
this scheme he would appear to have been urged by
the extravagant manner in which he had for some
time lived; but a more practicable, or at least a
more certain mode of recovering from the effects of
this false step presented itself; which was no other
than reducing his expenses, and living within his income.
This he had the courage to undertake and
execute; and from that day forward seems to have
led the life of a sensible man. His passion now
took a new turn, and he was wholly absorbed by
chymistry. In September, 1816, he wrote as follows
to a friend: “I sacrificed the whole month of
August to chymistry. Oh how I did work! It was
delightful play to me, and I stuck to it day and night.
At last, having blown off both my eyebrows and eyelashes,
and nearly blown out both my eyes, I ended
with a bang that shook all the houses round my lecture-room.
The Cambridge paper has told you the
result of all this alchymy, for I have actually decomposed
the earths, and obtained them in a metallic
form.”</p>

<p>I adopt from Mr. Otter the following account of
Clarke’s death. It was hastened, if not entirely
caused, by continued high-wrought mental excitement.
He was carried to town for advice by Sir
William and Lady Rush, where he was attended by
Sir Astley Cooper, Dr. Bailey, and Dr. Scudamore,
but their efforts to save him were in vain; the rest
of his life, about a fortnight, over which a veil will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
soon be drawn, was like a feverish dream after a day
of strong excitement, when the same ideas chase
each other through the mind in a perpetual round,
and baffle every attempt to banish them. Nothing
seemed to occupy his attention but the syllabus of
his lectures, and the details of the operations he had
just finished; nor could there exist to his friends a
stronger proof that all control over his mind was
gone, and that the ascendency of such thoughts at a
season when the devotion so natural to him, and of
late so strikingly exhibited under circumstances far
less trying, would, in a sounder state, have been the
prime, if not the only, mover of his soul. One lucid
interval there was, in which, to judge from the subject
and the manner of his conversation, he had the
command of his thoughts, as well as a sense of his
danger; for in the presence of Lieut. Chappel and
Mr. Cripps, he pronounced a very pathetic eulogium
on Mrs. Clarke, and recommended her earnestly to
the care of those about him; but when the currents
of his thoughts seemed running fast towards those
pious contemplations on which they would naturally
have rested, his mind suddenly relapsed into the
power of its former occupants, from which it never
more was free. At times, indeed, gleams of his
former kindness and intelligence would mingle
with the wildness of his delirium, in a manner the
most striking and affecting; and then, even his
incoherences, to use his own thoughts respecting
another person who had finished his race shortly
before him, was as the wreck of some beautiful decayed
structure, when all its goodly ornaments and
stately pillars fall in promiscuous ruin. He died on
Saturday, the 9th of March, and was buried in Jesus
College chapel on the 18th of the same month.</p>

<p>In commencing the life of this traveller I experience
some apprehension that the interest of the
narrative may suffer in my hands; since his exploits,
as Sallust observes of those of the Athenians, appear
to acquire much of their importance from the
peculiar eloquence with which they are described.
The style of Le Vaillant, though regarded by many
as declamatory and negligent, is in fact so graceful,
natural, and full of vivacity,&mdash;his sentiments are so
warm,&mdash;his ideas, whether right or wrong, so peculiarly
his own, that, whether he desires to interest
you in the fate of his friends or of his cattle, of
his collections or of his cocks and hens, the result
is invariably the same: he irresistibly inspires you
with feelings like his own, and for the moment compels
you, in spite of yourself, to adopt his views and
opinions. I cannot, however, flatter myself with the
hope of equal success. Things really trifling in
themselves might, I am afraid, continue to appear
so when dressed in my plain style; and it therefore
only remains for me to select, to the best of my
judgment, such actions and events as really deserve
to be remembered, and must always, with whatever
degree of simplicity they may be described, command
a certain degree of attention. The scene of
this writer’s adventures had in many instances all
the charm of novelty when his travels first appeared.
No European had preceded him in his route.
He could form no conjecture respecting the nature
of the objects with which the morrow was to bring

<p>In all the pleasures to be derived from pursuing an
untrodden path, from penetrating into an unknown
world; for such then was Africa, and such, in a
great measure, it still continues&mdash;from beholding
new species of birds and animals which his enthusiasm
and perseverance were about to make known
to mankind;&mdash;in all these pleasures, I say, he skilfully
makes his readers his associates, and thus, apparently
without effort, accomplishes the intention
of the most consummate rhetorical art, the object
of which is only to lead the imagination captive by
the allurements of pleasure, or to urge it along by
the keen sting of curiosity.</p>

<p>François le Vaillant was born in 1753, at Paramaribo,
in Dutch Guiana, where his father, a rich merchant,
originally from Metz, filled the office of consul.
Even while a child the tastes and habits of his
parents inspired him with a partiality for a wandering
life, and for collections of objects of natural history,
which quickly generated another passion, the
passion for hunting; and this amusement, unphilosophical
as it may seem, not only occupied his boyish
days, in which man is cruel from thoughtlessness,
but his riper and declining years, when suffering
and calamity might have taught him to respect
the lives even of the inferior animals.</p>

<p>His father, actuated by the love of science, or by
the vanity of forming a collection, employed much
of the leisure which he enjoyed in travelling through
the less frequented parts of the colony, accompanied
by his wife and son; and to this circumstance may
be attributed Le Vaillant’s twofold passion for travelling
and for natural history. The desire of possessing
a cabinet of his own soon arose. Birds and
beasts being as yet beyond his reach, he commenced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
with caterpillars, butterflies, and other insects; but
his ambition increasing with his acquisitions, he at
length armed himself with the Indian sarbacan and
bow, and before he had reached his tenth year had
slain innumerable birds.</p>

<p>In 1763 he proceeded with his parents to Europe,
where every object which presented itself to his eye
was new. They first landed in Holland, where the
phlegmatic Dutchmen, who, like the Chinese, pique
themselves upon being “slow and sure,” viewed with
astonishment the pert and forward urchin, who, at ten
years of age, began to babble of science, cabinets,
and collections. From Holland, however, they soon
removed to the more congenial soil of France. Here
precocity, which too frequently generates hopes
never destined to be fulfilled, has always been viewed
with more complacency than in any other country
in Europe; and accordingly our youthful traveller,
whose vanity amply made up for his want of knowledge,
was flattered and encouraged to his heart’s
content. In this particular instance the flowers were
succeeded by fruit. Being capable of existing in
solitude, which is difficult in youth, but yet absolutely
necessary to the acquisition of studious habits,
he yielded to his natural inclination for the chase,
and spent whole weeks in the forests of Lorrain and
Germany, intently studying the manners of animals
and birds. His education, meanwhile, was not in
other respects neglected; but the books which occupied
him most agreeably were voyages and travels,
as his mind seems already to have turned towards
that point from which he was to derive his fame.</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1777 some fortunate circumstance
conducted him to Paris, where the collections
and cabinets of learned and scientific men
at first afforded him extraordinary delight; but
ended, he says, by inspiring him with contempt, the
richness of the treasures which they contained being
equalled only by the confusion and absurdity observable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
in their arrangement. He discovered likewise
in the current works on natural history, even
in those of Buffon, so much exaggeration, and so
many errors, notwithstanding the masterly eloquence
with which those errors are clothed, that, convinced
that no degree of genius could preserve from delusion
the man who describes nature at second-hand,
he at length determined to become a traveller before
he became a natural historian, that he might observe
in their native woods and deserts the animals which
he wished to make known to the world. With these
views, without communicating his plans to any person,
he departed from Paris on the 17th of July,
1780, and proceeded to Holland.</p>

<p>Having visited the principal cities of the republic,
and admired at Amsterdam the superb collection and
aviary of M. Temminck and others, he obtained permission
to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope in one
of the ships of the Dutch East India Company, and
set sail for that country on the 3d of December, 1780,
the day before England declared war against the
Dutch. Had this event taken place twenty-four
hours sooner, the company, he observes, would not
have allowed them to depart; in which case all his
projects might have been frustrated. During the
voyage the ship was cannonaded during several
hours by a small English privateer, while the Dutch
captain, rendered incapable of reflection by terror,
never returned a single shot; and although exceedingly
superior in men and metal to the enemy, would
undoubtedly have suffered himself to be taken prisoner,
had not another Dutch ship-of-war hove in
sight, and put to flight the audacious Englishman.
This was the only incident worthy of mention which
occurred to dissipate the <i>ennui</i> of their long voyage;
and they arrived at Cape Town three months and
ten days after their departure from the Texel.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant, who had taken care to provide himself
previous to his departure from Amsterdam with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
numerous letters of recommendation, was received
with remarkable attention by several individuals of
distinction at the Cape. His design of exploring
the remoter districts of the colony and the adjacent
countries fortunately excited no jealousy or suspicion
in their minds, and therefore, instead of labouring,
as petty colonial governments too frequently
do, to obstruct the interests of science, they evinced
a disposition to favour the views of the traveller,
entertained him with profuse hospitality during the
many months which the preparations for his journey
required him to remain among them, and, which to
him was still more important, exerted their influence
and authority to facilitate his movements towards
the countries of the interior. So agreeable a reception
could not, of course, fail to produce its effect
upon the mind of the traveller. It quite melted
away his affected misanthropy. He found himself
in good-humour with mankind, and, as if benevolence
and philanthropy were the peculiar attributes of the
natives of Holland, observes, that this species of politeness
was what he had reckoned upon, for that he
knew he had to deal with Dutchmen!</p>

<p>His remarks upon Cape Town, now no longer in
the possession of the Dutch, are sufficiently curious,
as they enable us to contrast its appearance fifty
years ago with that which it at present wears under
English government. Though a large proportion
of the houses were spacious and handsome, the
streets, in spite of their great breadth, appeared disagreeable
even to a Frenchman, on account of the
badness of the pavement, and the stench which
everywhere offended the nostrils, arising from the
heads, feet, and intestines of slaughtered animals
which the butchers of the company were in the habit
of casting forth in heaps before their doors, and
which, with more than Ottomite negligence, the authorities
allowed to putrefy upon the spot. The effluvia
proceeding from these abominations Le Vaillant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
with reason regarded as one of the active causes of
those epidemics which usually prevailed in the city
during those seasons in which the violent south-east
wind had not blown. While this cleansing wind was
performing its operations, the streets were almost
rendered impassable. The hurricane, precipitating
from the mountains dense masses of vapour, raged
for several days with indescribable impetuosity, overthrowing
every thing in its course, and filling all
places, even to the closets, trunks, and drawers, with
dust. Trees and plants were frequently torn up by
the roots; and well-planted gardens were rendered
in the course of twenty-four hours as bare and naked
as a desert.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant found the native colonists of the Cape
handsome and well formed, particularly the women;
but, although they studied with perseverance the important
science of dress, they were still very far, in
his opinion, from the ease and elegance of the ladies
of France; a result which he in a great measure
attributes to the practice of employing slaves as wet-nurses,
and of otherwise living with them in habits
of great familiarity. Slavery under any form is a
thing to be abhorred; but our traveller here seems
to exaggerate its deformities. Gracefulness, taste,
decorum, which should, perhaps, be numbered among
the virtues in a well-regulated state, are things with
which slavery is by no means incompatible. The
most polished nation of antiquity, which every person
but a Frenchman will allow to have at least
equalled the Parisians in refinement, constantly employed
domestic slaves, and lived with them on terms
of considerable familiarity. But ignorance and refinement
are necessarily repugnant to each other;
and in general the Dutch inhabitants of the Cape
were, according to Le Vaillant, remarkable for their
ignorance, which, without the aid of slavery, would
sufficiently account for the absence of graceful and
elegant manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Strangers, however, arriving at the Cape were
almost invariably received with great hospitality,
more particularly the English, who were admired
for their generosity, as much as the French, for their
sordid avarice and egotism, were despised and hated.
Le Vaillant, in fact, observes that he has frequently
heard colonists declare they would prefer being
conquered by the English to their owing their safety
to a nation whom they regarded with such aversion
as the French; and the French troops which shortly
afterward arrived in the colony, spreading around
them vice and profligacy like a pestilence, debauching
the wives and daughters of those who hospitably
received them into their houses, and sowing dissension
and eternal regrets in the bosoms of a hundred
families, fully justified this deep-rooted hatred.
The great number of persons in France who from
selfish motives remain unmarried, and speculate
upon the gratification of their feeble passions at the
expense of the weak-minded and the miserable, must
always render the nation an object of aversion
among a remote people like the Dutch colonists of
the Cape, whose ignorant simplicity necessarily exposes
them to the shame of suffering by such immorality.</p>

<p>But if the English were so much the objects of admiration
to the people, their numerous and powerful
fleets, which have for centuries exercised an undisputed
omnipotence on the ocean, rendered them no
less terrible to the authorities, who, to secure the
company’s vessels from their dreaded cannon, commanded
them to be removed from Table Bay to that
of Saldanha, where, it was hoped, their chances of
escape would be more numerous. On board of one
of these our traveller embarked on the 10th of May,
and next morning arrived safely in the Bay of Saldanha,
happy that the dreaded English flag had not
encountered them on their passage.</p>

<p>In the waters of this bay, which was then but seldom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
visited, great numbers of whales were continually
seen sporting about; and Le Vaillant, whose
hunting propensities were immediately awakened by
the sight of a wild animal, frequently amused himself
with firing at this new species of game. He
could never perceive, however, that his balls produced
the least effect upon them. But in Mutton
Island, situated in the entrance of the bay, his fowlingpiece
was more fortunate; for, from the prodigious
number of rabbits with which that isle abounded, he
found it easy on all occasions to kill as many as he
pleased. In fact, this little isle became the warren
of the whole fleet.</p>

<p>Various species of game abounded in the neighbourhood,
among which the principal were the partridge
and the hare, and that small kind of gazelle
denominated steen-bock by the colonists. The panther,
too, following in the track of his prey, was
found in great numbers in this district. A few days
after his arrival Le Vaillant was invited by the commandant
to join him in a hunting-party. Their chase
was unsuccessful: they killed nothing. Towards
the close of the day, as if fate had decreed that his
courage should at once be put to the proof, Le Vaillant
found himself separated from his companion;
and continuing as he proceeded to fire at intervals,
in the hope of arousing the game, he started a small
gazelle, which his dog immediately pursued. The
gazelle was quickly out of sight, but the dog, which
still seemed to be upon his track, stopped on the
skirts of a large thicket, and began to bark. Le
Vaillant, who had now no doubt that the game had
taken refuge there, hastened to the spot with all the
eagerness of a sportsman. His presence encouraged
the dog, and he every moment expected to see the
gazelle appear; but at length, growing impatient, he
entered into the thicket, beating the bushes aside
with his fowlingpiece. It is difficult, however, to
describe the terror and confusion he experienced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
when, instead of a timid and feeble gazelle, he saw
before him a tremendous panther, whose glaring
eyes were fixed upon him, while its outstretched
neck, gaping jaws, and low, hollow growl seemed to
announce its intention of springing. He regarded
himself as lost. But the calm courage of his dog
saved his life. It kept the animal at bay, hesitating
between rage and fear, until the traveller had retreated
out of the thicket. He then made towards
the house of the commandant with all possible speed,
frequently looking behind him as he ran.</p>

<p>Another kind of terror shortly after seized upon
him at sea. He was sitting at supper with the captain
and the other officers, when a sudden strange
motion was observed in the ship. Every person immediately
ran on deck. The whole crew were
alarmed. Some imagined they had run upon their
anchors, and were beating against the rocks; others
accounted for the shock in a different manner; but,
perceiving from the position of the other ships that
they were still exactly where they had been before,
no one could conjecture the cause of what had happened,
and their alarm was redoubled. Presently,
however, upon more careful observation, a whale
was discovered entangled by the tail, between the
ship’s cables, and making furious efforts to disengage
itself. This was the cause of the singular motion
they had felt. All hands now rushed with harpoons
into the boat; but the obscurity of the night
retarding their movements, the whale, just as they
were ready to attack it, succeeded in disentangling
its tail, and escaped.</p>

<p>In the entrance to Saldanha Bay there is a second
small island, to which the colonists have given the
name of the Marmotte. Upon this sequestered spot
the captain of a Danish vessel, as our traveller had
learned from tradition, having been long detained in
the bay by contrary winds, had died there, and been
buried by his crew. Le Vaillant now conceived the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
desire of visiting his grave. In sailing by this lonely
rock, in the passage to and from Mutton Island, he
had invariably been struck by a dull but startling
sound, proceeding from the isle. He mentioned the
circumstance to the captain. The good-natured
navigator, anxious to oblige his guest, and perhaps
himself desirous of beholding the Dane’s grave, replied,
that if his wishes pointed that way they should
immediately be gratified.</p>

<p>Next morning, accordingly, they proceeded towards
the island. In proportion as they advanced,
the noise, increasing in loudness, more and more excited
their curiosity; and the sound of the waves,
which broke with great violence against the rocks,
contributed not a little to swell the deep murmur,
the cause of which no one could conjecture. They
landed at length amid spray and foam, and, clambering
up the cliffs, succeeded with much difficulty in
reaching the summit. Here they beheld a sight
such, in the opinion of our traveller, as no mortal
ever beheld before. There arose in a moment from
the surface of the earth an impenetrable cloud, which
formed, at the height of forty feet above their heads,
a prodigious canopy, or rather sky, of birds of every
kind and colour. “Cormorants, sea-swallows, pelicans,&mdash;in
one word,” says he, “all the winged creatures
of Southern Africa were collected, I verily
believe, in that spot. The screams of so enormous
a multitude of birds mingling together formed an
infernal species of music, which seemed to rend the
ear with its piercing notes.</p>

<p>“The alarm,” he adds, “was so much the greater,
among these innumerable legions of birds, in that it
was the females with whom we had principally to
deal, it being the season of nesting. They had
therefore their nests, their eggs, their young ones to
defend, and were as fierce as so many harpies.
They deafened us with their cries. They stooped
upon the wing, and in darting past us, brushed our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
faces. It was in vain that we fired our pieces; nothing
could frighten away this living cloud. We could
scarcely take a single step without crushing some
eggs or young birds: the earth was covered by them.”</p>

<p>They found the caverns and hollows of the rocks
inhabited by seals and sea-lions, of the latter of
which they killed one specimen of enormous size.
The various creeks of the island afforded a retreat
to the manchot, a species of penguin, two feet in
height, the wings of which, being entirely devoid of
feathers, are only used in swimming. On land they
hang down by the side of the body in a negligent manner,
and communicate to the appearance and air of
the bird something peculiarly sinister and funereal.
These dismal-looking birds crowded every part of the
island, but were nowhere so numerous as about the
Dane’s tomb, around which they clustered as if to
defend it from violation, and with their startling,
melancholy cry, which mingled with the roar of the
seal and the sea-lion, gave an air of sadness to the
scene which deeply affected the soul. In itself the
tomb was rude and simple,&mdash;a single block of stone,
without name or inscription.</p>

<p>During the whole of his stay on this part of the
coast Le Vaillant was actively employed in adding
to his collection, which, with his money, clothes, and
papers, continued on board the Middleburg, the
principal ship on the station. He had now been
three months in this neighbourhood, which he had
traversed in every direction. He still continued,
however, to roam about with his dog and gun in
search of birds and animals; but one day, on approaching
the shore, the roaring of cannon struck
his ear. He at first supposed it might be some <i>fête</i>
given on board the ships, and hastened his march as
much as possible, in the hope of sharing in the
rejoicings. Upon his reaching the downs overlooking
the bay, a very different spectacle presented
itself. The Middleburg had just been blown up, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
its burning fragments still filled the air, or lay widely
scattered upon the sea! Here, then, was the end
of all his hopes; for not only the results of his
labours, but his fortune, the basis upon which all his
projects were founded, was now destroyed.</p>

<p>The cause of this calamity was soon discovered.
The English fleet, having obtained intelligence of the
retreat of the Dutch, had burst upon them so suddenly,
that the terrified commanders had all, with the
exception of Vangenep, the commander of the Middleburg,
been taken unawares, and prevented from
executing the orders they had received, rather to
run aground, sink, or blow up their ships, than suffer
them to fall into the hands of the enemy. Instead
of this, they all abandoned their vessels at the first
appearance of the English, the sailors, notwithstanding
their apprehensions of the enemy, carrying
away with them every thing they could bring on
shore, though the desire to escape beyond reach of
the English cannon quickly compelled them to cast
their burdens on the ground. Everywhere the roads
and paths were crowded with fugitives, and covered
with the plunder which they had abandoned on the
way. Among the rest, an English prisoner was
flying from the shore. Le Vaillant met him, and
having, as well as he could, questioned him in
English respecting the horrible catastrophe, was
expecting an answer, when a cannon-ball carried off
his head, and the answer with it. A large dog,
which was running about wild and trembling, apparently
in search of his master, was next moment
killed by another ball; and Le Vaillant, apprehensive
that the third might reach himself, immediately fled
over the downs, and ensconced himself behind an
eminence.</p>

<p>His position at this moment, it must be confessed,
was sufficiently calamitous. To repair to the Cape,
there to petition among a crowd of adventurers and
unfortunates for pecuniary aid, was a step he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
ill brook; yet, unless he submitted to this humiliation,
what must be his fate? His family, his friends,
his adopted country were two thousand leagues distant.
His whole resources now consisted in his
fowlingpiece, the clothes he then wore, and ten
ducats. His misfortunes presented themselves to
his mind in all their horrors, and he burst into tears,&mdash;a
trait of weakness for which he might have
pleaded the example of Homer’s and Virgil’s poetical
heroes. An honest colonist, however, to whose
house he repaired in this extremity, received him
with a frank hospitality, which in some degree dissipated
his chagrin; and he next day returned, though
not without melancholy, to the first elements of his
collection.</p>

<p>His misfortunes were soon known at the Cape,
and in a few days after this occurrence he was again
placed, by the friendship of M. Boers, the fiscal, in
a condition to act as if nothing had happened. He
therefore directed his attention to the preparations
required by his projected journey into the interior;
and these, from the style in which he designed to
travel, were numerous and considerable. He caused
to be constructed two large four-wheeled wagons,
covered above with double canvass, in one of which
were placed five large packing-cases, which exactly
filled the bottom of the vehicle, and could be opened
without being removed. Over these was spread a
mattress, on which he might occasionally sleep; and
on this mattress, which during the day was rolled
up in the back of the wagon, he placed the cabinet
fitted up with drawers, in which he intended to preserve
his insects. The other cases were filled with
powder, lead for casting balls, tobacco, hardware,
brandy, and toys. He had sixteen fowlingpieces,
one of which, calculated for shooting elephants, rhinoceroses,
and hippopotami, carried a quarter of a
pound ball. Besides these he had several pairs of
double-barrelled pistols, a scimitar, and a dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>The second wagon carried his kitchen utensils,
which, as he was rather addicted to luxurious eating,
were numerous for a traveller: a gridiron, a frying-pan,
two kettles, a caldron, tea-kettles, tea-pots,
coffee-pots, basins, plates, dishes, &amp;c. of porcelain.
To supply these he laid in a large store of white
sugar, coffee, tea, chocolate, and sugar-candy. His
brandy and tobacco, to the use of which he was not
at all addicted, were designed to purchase friends
among the natives, and to keep his Hottentot attendants
in good-humour. In addition to his wagons he
had a great and a small tent, and numerous other
conveniences, which he describes with great complacency.
His train consisted of five Hottentots,
nine dogs, and thirty oxen; but both his servants
and his cattle were afterward considerably increased.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant judged rightly, that on proceeding on
such an expedition it would be imprudent to have
any associate of equal rank. Few men are calculated
by nature to become travellers, though every
person whose constitution will endure fatigue may
perform a journey; but there are still fewer who are
gifted with those happy qualities which render men
desirable companions in an undertaking whence fame
is expected to be derived. Some, from feebleness
of purpose, desert you almost at the outset, and, to
conceal their own pusillanimity, represent you in
their coteries as feeble, or selfish, or impracticable;
others, more mischievous still, proceed so far that
they cannot return, but, clinging to your skirts, contrive
on every trying occasion to impede your movements,
or cast a damp upon your energies; while a
third class, too brave to feel alarm, too consistent
to shrink from an enterprise begun, too honest to
misrepresent you, will yet thwart your designs
through obstinacy, or through the pardonable but
fatal desire to follow a plan of their own. For these
reasons our traveller, though solicited by many who
would have gladly borne him company, steadily refused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
to admit of an associate, and determined to
proceed on his journey alone.</p>

<p>His preparations being at length completed, he
took leave of his friends, and departed from Cape
Town on the 18th of December, 1781. Whatever
be the natural condition of man, his mind never so
powerfully experiences the emotions of delight as
when, escaping voluntarily from the restraints of
society and civilization, he finds himself his own
master, and trusting to his own prowess for protection,
on the virgin bosom of the earth; for of all the
enjoyments which Heaven bestows upon mankind
perfect liberty is the sweetest. Something of this
Le Vaillant now tasted; for, although still within
the pale of the laws and the purlieus of government,
he saw himself on the way to the freedom of the
woods, and partook by anticipation of those pleasures
which to the savage are, perhaps, an ample
equivalent for the gratification which letters and refinement
afford.</p>

<p>The direction of his course lay along the eastern
coast, towards the country of the Kaffers. At intervals
the houses of colonists, with their orchards and
plantations, appeared; but they became thinner as
he advanced, while the woods and general scenery
increased in magnificence; and the troops of wild
animals, such as the zebra and the antelope, which
stretched themselves out like armies on the plain,
became strikingly more numerous and of more frequent
occurrence. “We likewise,” says the traveller,
“saw several ostriches; and the variety and the
movements of these vast hordes were particularly
amusing. My dogs fiercely pursued all these different
species of animals, which, mingling together in
their flight, often formed but one enormous column.
This confusion, however, like that of theatrical machines,
lasted but for a moment. I recalled my
dogs, and in an instant each animal had regained his
own herd, which constantly kept at a certain distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
from all the others.” Among these animals
were the blue antelope, the rarest and most beautiful
of all the known species of gazelle.</p>

<p>The habits of a small kind of tortoise, which
afforded them the materials of various feasts during
this part of the journey, are very remarkable. When
the great heats of summer arrive, and dry up the
ponds in which they pass the winter, they descend
into the earth in search of humidity, deeper and
deeper in proportion as the sun penetrates farther
and farther into the soil. In this position they remain
plunged in a kind of lethargy until the return
of the rainy season; but those who require them for
food may always, by digging, discover an ample supply.
Their eggs, which they lay on the brink of
the small lakes and ponds which they inhabit, and
abandon to be hatched by the sun, are about the size
of those of the pigeon, and extremely good eating.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant was careful as he went along to augment
his followers, both rational and irrational. He
hired several new Hottentots, and purchased a number
of oxen, with a milch-cow, and some she-goats,
whose milk he foresaw might be an important possession
in various circumstances. He likewise purchased
a cock to awake him in the morning, and a
monkey, which, besides serving as an almost unerring
taster, his instinct enabling him immediately to
distinguish such fruits and herbs as were innoxious
and wholesome from such as were hurtful, was a
still better watchman even than the dog, as the
slightest noise, the most distant sign of danger, instantly
awakened his terrors, and, by the cries and
gestures of fear which it extorted from him, put his
master upon his guard.</p>

<p>Thus accompanied, he continued his journey towards
the east, until his progress was stopped by
the Dove’s River, upon the banks of which he determined
to encamp until the decrease of its waters
should render it fordable. His mode of life, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
the hospitable invitations of the neighbouring colonists,
to whom the sight of a stranger was like a
spring in the desert, were not suffered to interrupt,
was exceedingly agreeable. “I regulated,” says he,
“the employment of my time, which was usually
spent in the following manner:&mdash;At night, when not
travelling, I slept in my wagon or in my tent; awakened
by the break of day by my cock, my first business
was to prepare my coffee, while the Hottentots,
on their part, were busied about the cattle. As soon
as the sun appeared I took my fowlingpiece, and,
setting out with my monkey, beat about the neighbourhood
until ten o’clock. On returning to my
tent, I always found it well swept and clean. The
superintendence of this part of my economy had
been confided to the care of an old African whose
name was Swanspoel, who, not being able to follow
us in our rambles, was intrusted with the government
of the camp, and invariably maintained it in
good order. The furniture of my tent was not very
abundant; a camp-stool or two, a table appropriated
to the dissection of my animals, and a few instruments
required in their preparation constituted the
whole of its ornaments. From ten o’clock until
twelve I was employed in my tents, classing in my
drawers the insects I had found. I then dined.
Placing upon my knees a small board covered with
a napkin, a single dish of roasted or broiled meat
was served up. After this frugal meal I returned to
my work, if I had left any thing unfinished, and then
amused myself with hunting until sunset. I then
retired to my tent, lighted a candle, and spent an
hour or two in describing my discoveries or the
events of the day in my journal. Meanwhile, the
Hottentots were employed in collecting the cattle,
and penning them around the tents and wagons.
The she-goats, as soon as they had been milked, lay
down here and there among the dogs. Business
being over, and the customary great fire kindled, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
gathered together in a circle. I then took my tea;
my people joyously smoked their pipes, and for my
amusement related stories, the humorous absurdity
of which almost made me crack my sides with laughter.
I delighted to encourage them, and they were
by no means timid with me, as I was careful to treat
them with frankness, cordiality, and attention. On
many occasions, in fact, when the beauty of the
evening succeeding the fatigues of the day had put
me in good-humour with myself and with every
thing about me, I involuntarily yielded to the spell,
and gently cherished the illusion. At such moments
every one disputed with his neighbour for the honour
of amusing me by his superior wit; and by the
profound silence which reigned among us, the able
story-teller might discover how highly we appreciated
his art. I know not what powerful attraction
continually leads my memory back to those peaceful
days! I still imagine myself in the midst of my
camp, surrounded by my people and my animals; an
agreeable site, a mountain, a tree,&mdash;nay, even a
plant, a flower, or a fragment of rock scattered here
and there,&mdash;nothing escapes from my memory; and
this spectacle, which daily grows more and more
affecting, amuses me, follows me into all places, and
has often made me forget what I have suffered from
men who call themselves civilized.”</p>

<p>Provisions were plentiful; partridges as large as
pheasants, and two kinds of antelopes, whose flesh
was tender and nourishing. The colonists of the
vicinity, rendered generous by abundance, gratuitously
furnished him with an ample provision of
milk, fruit, and vegetables, which the traveller shared
with his monkey and his Hottentots. From this
position, however, he was at length, by the shrinking
of the river, enabled to remove; and, continuing
to pursue his route in the same direction as before,
he crossed several diminutive streams, and arrived
on the banks of the river Gaurits, where, the stream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
not being fordable, he encamped for three days
among groves of mimosa-trees. Perceiving no sign
of abatement in the waters, he then constructed a
raft, upon which his wagons and baggage were ferried
over, while the oxen and other animals swam
across.</p>

<p>His road during this part of the journey lay at no
great distance from the sea, which therefore communicated
a refreshing coolness to the breezes, presented
him at intervals with magnificent prospects,
and at the same time administered pabulum to his
passion for shooting, its solitary margin affording a
retreat to thousands of flamingoes and pelicans.
His animals, meanwhile, fared luxuriously. The
soil throughout these districts was remarkable for
its fertility; but a small canton, a little to the east
of Mossel Bay, called the country of the Auteniquas,
surpassed in beauty and magnificence all the landscapes
of southern Africa. Having with considerable
toil ascended to the summit of a mountain, “we
were well repaid,” says Le Vaillant, “for the fatigue
which we had undergone. Our admiration was excited
by the loveliest country in the world. In the
distance appeared the chain of mountains covered
with forests, which bounded the prospect on the
west; beneath our feet the eye wandered over an
immense valley, the aspect of which was diversified
by hillocks, infinitely varied in form, and descending
in wavy swells towards the sea. Richly enamelled
meadows and splendid pasture-grounds still
further increased the beauty of this magnificent landscape.
I was literally in ecstasy. This country
bears the name of Auteniquas, which, in the Hottentot
idiom, signifies ‘the man laden with honey;’
and, in fact, we could not proceed a single step without
beholding a thousand swarms of bees. The
flowers grew in myriads, and the mingled perfume
which exhaled from them, and deliciously intoxicated
the senses, their colours, their variety, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
cool pure air which we breathed, every thing united
to arrest our footsteps. Nature has bestowed the
charms of fairy-land upon this spot. Almost every
flower was filled with exquisite juices, and furnished
the bees with abundant materials for the fabrication
of their honey, which they deposited in every hollow
rock and tree.”</p>

<p>This description, which no doubt falls far short of
the reality&mdash;for what language can equal the beauties
of nature?&mdash;reminds me strongly of Spenser’s
noble picture of the Gardens of Adonis. Poetry
itself, however, with all its metaphors and picturesque
expressions, is faint and dim compared with
the splendour of a summer landscape, where earth,
air, and sea unite their rich hues and sublime aspect
to entrance and dazzle the eye. But our old bard,
whom no man ever excelled in minute painting of
inanimate nature, contrives, by careful and repeated
touches, to unfold before the imagination an exquisite
view. “There,” says he, speaking of the
gardens of the Assyrian youth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is continual spring, and harvest there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Continual, both meeting at one time:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For both the boughs do laughing blossoms bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with fresh flowers deck the wanton prime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And eke at once the heavy trees they climb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which seem to labour under their fruit’s load:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The while the joyous birds make their pastime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the shady leaves, their sweet abode,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And their true loves without suspicion tell abroad.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">

<hr class="tb" /></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And all about grew every sort of flower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To which sad lovers were transformed of yore,” &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dwellings which the few colonists, who had
been led by poverty so far from the Cape, erected
in the midst of this smiling scene, offered a striking
contrast with it. Huts covered with earth, like the
dens of wild animals, in which the inhabitants passed
the night stretched upon a buffalo’s hide, afforded
shelter to men who lived in plenty, and were thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
badly lodged from mere idleness. It is now inhabited
by Englishmen, and the contrast, it may well
be imagined, no longer exists.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant, who apprehended that the country of
the Auteniquas might prove a kind of Capua to his
followers, made no stay in it, but pushed forward
with all speed, and encamped on the skirts of an immense
forest. This wood abounded with touracos,
a species of bird of which he had hitherto been able
to procure no specimen. His first business therefore
was, if possible, to possess himself of this bird.
His scientific ardour was kindled. He scoured the
woods. The touraco presented itself before him,
but its habits unfortunately inclining it always to
perch upon the tops of the loftiest trees, he could
never succeed in bringing it down. One afternoon,
however, his eagerness increasing with his disappointments,
he determined not to desist from the
pursuit of his prey, and the bird, which appeared to
delight in mocking him, confined itself to short
flights, flitting from tree to tree, until it had drawn
him to a considerable distance from his camp.
Growing impatient, at length the traveller, though
still believing the bird beyond the reach of his fowlingpiece,
fired, and had the unexpected satisfaction
of seeing it drop from the tree. His joy now knew
no bounds. He rushed on to snatch up his prey,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thorough bush, thorough briar,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>until his hands and legs were dripping with blood;
but when he came up to the spot where the touraco
should have been, he could discover nothing. He
searched the surrounding thickets again and again; he
proceeded farther, he returned, he examined the same
spots twenty times, he peeped into every bush, into
every hole; his labour was in vain. No touraco. “I
was,” says he, “in despair, and the thick brushwood
and thorny shrubs, which had now covered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
even my very face with blood, had irritated me in an
indescribable manner. Nothing less than the appearance
of a lion or a tiger could at that moment
have calmed my rage. That a wretched bird, which,
after so many wishes and so much toil, I had at
length succeeded in bringing down, should after all
escape from me in so unaccountable a manner! I
struck my fowlingpiece against the earth, and
stamped with passion. All at once the ground gave
way under my feet; I disappeared, and sunk, with
my arms in my hand, into a pit twelve feet deep.
Astonishment, and the pain caused by the fall, now
succeeded my rage. I saw myself in one of those
covered pitfalls which the Hottentots construct for
the taking of wild beasts, particularly the elephant.
When I had recovered from my surprise I began
to reflect upon the means of escaping, and congratulated
myself that I had not fallen upon the
sharp stake fixed up at the bottom of the pit to impale
the wild animals, and that I found no company
in the snare. But as it was every moment possible
that some might arrive, particularly during the night,
should I be compelled to remain there so long, my
terrors quickly increased as darkness approached,
and retarded the execution of the only plan I could
imagine for extricating myself without assistance;
this was to cut out a kind of steps with my sabre in
the sides of the pit, but this operation would be a
tedious one. In this dilemma the idea of the only
rational plan suggested itself; which was, to pick
up and load my fusil. I did so, and fired shot after
shot. It was possible I might be heard by my attendants.
I therefore listened from time to time
with the most painful anxiety and a palpitating
heart, in order to discover whether my signal had
been heard. At last two shots re-echoed through
the wood, and overwhelmed me with joy. I now
continued firing at intervals, in order to guide my
deliverers to the spot, and in a short time they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
arrived, armed to the teeth, and full of uneasiness and
alarm.”</p>

<p>He was immediately delivered from the elephant-trap;
but having incurred so much risk in searching
for the touraco, he made it a point of honour not to
be balked, and recommencing his scrutiny, with
the dogs which had arrived with his servants, found
it jammed close under a small bush. He immediately
seized upon his prey, and the pleasure of possessing
this new and rare bird very quickly obliterated
from his memory the trouble and danger which
it had cost him.</p>

<p>In this encampment they remained until the setting
in of the rains, when storms, accompanied by
tremendous thunder, succeeded each other with singular
rapidity. The thunderbolt several times fell
near them in the forest. The whole country round
was flooded, but they still clung to their encampment,
until the whole was at length overflowed
during the night. They then removed; but could
proceed but a very short distance, for every paltry
stream was now swelled to a furious torrent, which
rushed down with impetuosity from the hills, rolling
along with it mud, trees, and fragments of rock, and
threatening whoever should attempt to traverse them
with destruction. Meanwhile his cattle, pressed
by hunger, had escaped from the camp; his dogs,
which no degree of want could estrange, were reduced
to skeletons, and fought with each other for
the most revolting food; his Hottentots, less affectionate
than the dogs, began to murmur, but could
discover no just cause of complaint, and were but
little disposed to aid themselves. A drowned buffalo,
however, which was accidentally found in one of
the torrents, came opportunely to appease their hunger;
they dragged it on shore with shouts of joy, and
having cut it in pieces, and given the dogs their
share, they feasted upon the remainder and were
happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>At length the month of March arrived, and the
rains abated. The torrents, ceasing to receive their
aliments from the clouds&mdash;for, like the Nile, they are
strictly διϊὲες&mdash;shrunk to their ordinary insignificance,
the camp was immediately put in motion, and
pushing onwards for a few leagues, they discovered
a more convenient site on the acclivity of a hill,
where they remained some time to recruit themselves
and their cattle. Le Vaillant travelled for
pleasure, and was gifted with the happy faculty of
discovering at a glance its springs and sources.
Near the site of his camp there was a small eminence,
the summit of which was crowned with a
diminutive grove, where the trees had so grown into
each other that the whole seemed one solid mass
of foliage. He immediately conceived the idea of
transforming this thicket into a palace; and causing
a covered entrance to be cut into the centre, he there
hewed out two large square apartments, one of which
was immediately converted into a study, and the
other into a kitchen. If we keep out of sight the
kitchen, and the share which art had in its formation,
Spenser has admirably described this arbour, as well
as the hill on which it stood:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Right in the middest of that paradise</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There stood a stately mount, on whose round top</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A gloomy grove of myrtle-trees did rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose shady boughs sharp steel did never lop,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor wicked beasts their tender buds did crop.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But like a girlond compassed the height,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And from their fruitful sides sweet gum did drop,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That all the ground, with precious dew bedight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Threw forth most dainty odours and most sweet delight.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">And in the thickest covert of that shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There was a pleasant arbour, not by art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But of the trees’ own inclination, made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which knitting their rank branches, part to part,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With wanton ivy-twine entrailed athwart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And eglantine and caprifole among,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fashioned above within their inmost part,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That neither Phœbus’ beams could through them throng,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor Æolus’ sharp blast could work them any wrong.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>But, whatever charms his arbours might possess
for him, his plans rendered it necessary soon to leave
them. He therefore, after spending a pleasant week
with M. Mulder, the last of the colonists in his route,
pushed on towards the Black River, which he crossed
on rafts, and at length found himself beyond the
Dutch settlements. Here an accident occurred
which might at once have terminated his journey.
In toiling up a rough, precipitous mountain, where
it was found necessary to yoke twenty oxen to a
wagon, the traces of the principal vehicle snapped
asunder, immediately in front of the great shaft-oxen,
which being unable to resist the enormous weight
to which they were attached, reeled back, and the
wagon at once rolled down along the edge of an
abyss; while Le Vaillant and his whole party stood
still, watching, with uplifted hands and looks of
dismay, each shock and slide of the cumbrous
machine, which, after twenty hair-breadth escapes,
ran against a large rock on the edge of the torrent,
and stopped, without receiving any material injury.
Loss of time, therefore, was the only injury he sustained.
By patience and industry they succeeded
in passing the mountain, which being effected, they
descended into a magnificent country, watered by
numerous rivers, covered with woods, abounding in
game, and affording numerous specimens of birds
and quadrupeds unknown to natural history.</p>

<p>In the midst of this new scene he was overtaken
by disease. Though of a disposition naturally intrepid,
the idea that he might be destined to perish
in the wilderness, surrounded by savages, two thousand
leagues from home, disturbed his imagination.
Charles the Twelfth of Sweden, attacked by a fever
when flying through the Ukraine after the battle of
Pultowa, experienced a diminution of courage, and,
unless my memory deceive me, was seen to shed
tears; and Cæsar, when the fit, as Shakspeare has
it, was on him, cried, “Give me some drink, Titinius,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
like a sick girl.” Le Vaillant, therefore, had good
authority for his melancholy. His temperament,
moreover, in proportion as it was more susceptible
of exhilarating impressions in health, was proner in
sickness to yield to despondency. He was, besides,
entirely ignorant of medicine; knew nothing of the
nature of the disease by which he was attacked;
and was surrounded by persons still more ignorant
than himself. All he could do, therefore, was to
remain quiet, and allow nature to work. For twelve
days he lingered on the confines of life and death,
kept in a perpetual bath of perspiration by the heat
of the atmosphere; and this heat was his Pæon and
Æsculapius, for by its sole aid the fever, which had
so fiercely menaced him, was entirely subdued.
However, it is extremely probable that he owed the
disease as well as the remedy to the climate. To
enhance his misfortunes, his Hottentots were at the
same time attacked by dysentery; but, by strictly
attending to regimen, a difficult task to a gross
and sensual people, they all, without exception, recovered.</p>

<p>This danger being removed, they proceeded on
their journey, the interest of which was every day
increased by the greater solitude of the scene, and
the more frequent occurrence of wild animals, or
their traces. I would willingly describe at length
the pleasures and the adventures of this romantic
excursion; but my plan forbids me to indulge in
voluminous details, and I want the art to present by
a few masterly strokes the whole of a complicated
and animated scene to the mind. However, I must
attempt what I can. After wandering a full month
in a vast plain, intersected by forests, and, in a manner,
walled round by precipices, they were driven
back upon their own footsteps, fatigued and mortified,
and unable to conjecture in what direction it
would be possible to advance. While they were in
this humour, they discovered in their route the footmarks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
of a herd of elephants. To Le Vaillant, who
had never yet enjoyed the satisfaction of hunting
this enormous animal, though it might, perhaps, be
said to have constituted one of his principal reasons
for travelling in Africa, the sight was sufficient to
restore his equanimity. The order for halting was
immediately given, and having, as soon as the tents
were pitched, selected five of his best marksmen,
our traveller set out in pursuit of the game.</p>

<p>The traces were so fresh and striking, that they
had no difficulty in following them. They therefore
pushed on vigorously, expecting every moment to
come in sight of the herd. But still they saw
nothing; and night coming on, they bivouacked in
the woods, and having supped gayly, lay down to
sleep, though not without considerable agitation and
alarm. At every puff of wind rustling through the
leaves, at every hum of a beetle, the whole party
was roused, and put upon its guard. It was feared
that the monsters of which they were in search
might rush upon them unawares, and trample them
to atoms. However, the night passed away, as did
likewise the day and night ensuing, without their
being disturbed by any thing more formidable than
a stray buffalo, which approaching the fire, and discovering
that it was in the vicinity of man, rushed
back with all speed into the woods.</p>

<p>On the third day, after a painful march among
briers and underwood, they arrived in a rather open
part of the forest, when one of the Hottentots, who
had climbed up into a tree to reconnoitre, perceived
the herd in the distance, and putting his finger on
his lips to enjoin silence, informed them by opening
and closing his hand of the number of the elephants.
He then came down; a council was held; and it
was determined they should approach them on the
lee-side that they might not be discovered. The
Hottentot now conducted Le Vaillant through the
bushes to a small knoll, and desiring him to cast his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
eyes in a certain direction, pointed out an enormous
elephant not many paces distant. At first, however,
Le Vaillant could see nothing; or, rather, he mistook
what he saw of the animal for a portion of the
rock by which it stood. But when at length a slight
motion had corrected his mistake, he distinguished
the head and enormous tusks of the beast turned
towards him. He instantly levelled his musket, and,
aiming at the brain, fired, and the elephant dropped
down dead. The report of the gun put the whole
herd, consisting of about thirty, to instant flight;
and our traveller beheld with amazement their huge
ears flapping the air with a violence in proportion
to the rapidity of their motion.</p>

<p>The whole party now experienced that joyous
alacrity which man always feels when engaged in
the work of destruction. They fired upon the
enemy, for as such the beasts were now to be regarded,
and the sight of the excrements mingled with
blood, which escaped from the wounded animal, and
informed them that their bullets had taken effect,
delighted them exceedingly. Their pursuit now
became more eager. The elephant, writhing with
pain, at one moment crouched to the earth, at another
rose, but only to fall again. The hunters,
however, who hung close upon his haunches, constantly
by fresh volleys compelled him to rise. In
this condition he rushed through the woods, snapping
off, or uprooting trees in his passage. At length,
becoming furious with pain, he turned round upon his
pursuers, who immediately fled in their turn. Le Vaillant,
more eager than the rest, had unhappily advanced
before them, and was now but twenty-five paces
from the animal. His gun of thirty pounds’ weight
impeded his movements. The enemy gained upon
him every moment. His followers gave him up for
lost; but just as the elephant had overtaken him, he
dropped down, and crept under the trunk of a fallen
tree, over which the furious beast, whose great height
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
prevents it, at least in such situations, from seeing
under its feet, bounded in an instant. Being terrified,
however, by the noise of the Hottentots, it had not
advanced many paces before it stopped, and with a
wild but searching eye, began to reconnoitre the
spot. Our traveller had his long gun in his hand,
and might, had he chosen, have fired upon his enemy;
but he knew that instant destruction must ensue
should he miss his aim, and he therefore preferred
trusting to the chances of concealment. Presently
the elephant faced about, and drew near the tree; but
he again leaped over it without perceiving Le Vaillant,
who, as soon as he retreated to a sufficient
distance, sprang from his hiding-place, and shot him
in the flank. Notwithstanding all this, he succeeded
in effecting his escape, though his bloody traces too
clearly showed the terrible condition to which their
balls had reduced him. In this critical conjuncture,
Klaas, his principal Hottentot, exhibited proofs of
courage and affection which infinitely endeared him
to his master, who thenceforward regarded him
more in the light of a brother than a servant.</p>

<p>To those who have all their lives been accustomed
to live upon the flesh of the ox and the sheep, elephant
cutlets may appear revolting; but in the deserts
of Africa, where imperious hunger silences the
objections of prejudice, and teaches man to regard
the whole animal creation as his farmyard, the palate
quickly accommodates itself to the viands within its
reach, and even learns to discover delicacy in things
which, in a fashionable dining-room, it might have
loathed. However this may be, Le Vaillant and his
Hottentots, whose appetites were grievously sharpened
by fatigue, immediately employed themselves
in cutting up and cooking their game. For the
former, as the most dainty personage of the party,
a few slices off the trunk were broiled, and he found
them so exquisite that, being as I have already said,
to a certain degree, an epicure, they gave him a taste
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
for elephant hunting, which he afterward seized
every occasion of indulging. But he was informed
by Klaas that by far the greatest delicacy, which
would cause him to forget the flavour of the trunk,
was yet to come. This consisted of the elephant’s
foot, which his people undertook to dress for his
breakfast.</p>

<p>The reader who has perused Captain Cook’s
“Voyages in the South Seas,” or Ledyard, or the
“Histoire Naturelle de l’Homme” of Lesson, will
remember the description given by those navigators
of the curious subterranean ovens employed by the
native islanders in cooking. A large opening is
made in the earth, which is filled with red-hot stones
or charcoal, and upon these a great fire is kept up
for several hours. The hole is then cleared, and
the thing which is to be baked inserted in the centre.
Then the top is again closed, and a blazing fire once
more kindled; which, having burned during a great
part of the night, is at length extinguished, when
the oven is opened, and the meat taken out, more
exquisitely cooked than any man accustomed to the
ordinary culinary processes can conceive.</p>

<p>Such was the process by which the elephant’s
feet were baked for Le Vaillant. When they presented
him one for breakfast, “The cooking,” says
he, “had enlarged it prodigiously; I could scarcely
recognise the form. But it looked so nice, and
exhaled so delicious an odour, that I was impatient
to taste it. It was a breakfast for a king. I had
heard much of the excellence of bears’ feet, but
could not have conceived that an animal so awkward,
so material as the elephant, could have afforded so
tender, so delicate a meat. Never have our modern
Luculluses, thought I, seen any thing comparable
upon their tables; it is in vain that they confound
and reverse the seasons by the force of gold, and
lay all the countries in the world under contribution:
there are bounds to their craving sensuality; they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
have never been able to reach this point.” I do not
see, however, what should prevent our rearing elephants,
as we rear sheep and oxen, for the slaughter;
in which case many persons, not ambitious of rivalling
Lucullus in luxury, might enjoy the sight of this
<i>ne plus ultra</i> of cooking upon their tables.</p>

<p>In proceeding eastward from this spot they encountered
a horde of wandering Hottentots, with
whose women our traveller’s followers, now considerably
increased in number, contracted connexions
with that easy effrontery which, at first consideration,
would appear to be an attribute peculiar to civilized
man. Le Vaillant is the apologist of the Hottentots;
they were the instruments of his pleasure.
His imagination associated them with romantic
wanderings, with adventures, with dangers, with
escapes; and when, after his return to France, he
wished to remember and paint them in their true
colours, the idea that they had been his companions,
that they had suffered privations, and tasted of many
enjoyments together, rushed into his mind, and
blinded his judgment by interesting his heart. This
natural result is not dishonourable to his feelings;
but it can have no influence with me. I have received
from them neither good nor harm. I must,
therefore, confess that in my estimation they rank
very low, even in the scale of savage excellence.
Timid even to cowardliness, they are not urged
by their temperament towards violence and bloodshed:
but this induces cringing and dastardly habits,
and causes them to desert their dearest friends when
in danger. Gratitude is a plant which flourishes
only in noble breasts. Among the Hottentots it is
feeble and shortlived, unless nourished by a constant
stream of benefits. That they have little religion,
or superstition, though no proof of immorality, is
an incontrovertible evidence of want of capacity and
genius; for intellect, wherever it exists, is skilful
in the discovery of intellect, and few, even among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
savage nations, are cursed with perceptions so obtuse
that they cannot, if I may venture so to express
myself, discover the footsteps of the sovereign intellect
among the phenomena of the visible world.
How far the profound indifference in which they are
said to grovel on this point may exist, however, I
will not presume to determine. It is possible that
travellers may sometimes make these and similar
savages the interpreters of their own thoughts.</p>

<p>On approaching the country of the Kaffers, a brave
and warlike people, exceedingly hostile to the Hottentots,
whom they regarded as the slaves and spies
of the colonists, the most terrible apprehensions were
awakened in his camp. Night and day they were
on the alert. Every sound which startled the darkness
was transformed, by their terror, into the footsteps
of a Kaffer; and if they did not at once burst
into open mutiny against their chief, it was rather
the fear of the dangers to which the loss of him
might expose them, than any ideas of discipline or
fidelity, that restrained them.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant’s determination, nevertheless, still was
to advance into Kaffraria; but finding after repeated
endeavours that no argument could prevail upon his
attendants, a very small number excepted, to accompany
him, he contented himself with despatching an
envoy to the Kaffer king, or chief. Meanwhile he continued
to roam about on the frontiers, hunting, shooting,
and adding to his collections. Here he encountered
the fury of an African tempest. “The rain,”
he observes, “fell all night in such abundance, that,
in spite of all our efforts, it extinguished our fires.
Our dogs made an indescribable clamour, and kept
us awake all night, though no wild beast appeared.
I have observed that during these rainy nights the
lion, the tiger, and the hyena are never heard; but
the danger is increased twofold; for, as they still
roam about, they thus fall suddenly and unexpectedly
on their prey. Still further to increase the fright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
which this unfortunate fact must occasion, the great
humidity almost entirely deprives the dogs of the
power of smelling, which renders them of little use.
Of this danger my people were well aware, and therefore
laboured with remarkable energy to keep alive
the fires.</p>

<p>“It must be confessed,” he continues, “that the
stormy nights of the African deserts are the very
image of desolation, and that terror, on such occasions,
involuntarily comes over one. When you are
overtaken by these deluges, your tents and mats are
quickly drenched and overflowed; a continual succession
of lightning-flashes causes you twenty
times in a minute to pass abruptly and suddenly from
the most terrific light to entire darkness: the deafening
roarings of the thunder, which burst from every
side with horrible din, roll, as it were, against each
other, are multiplied by the echoes, and hurled from
peak to peak; the howling of the domestic animals;
short intervals of fearful silence; every thing concurs
to render those moments more melancholy.
The danger to be apprehended from wild beasts still
further increases the terror; and nothing but day can
lessen the alarm, and restore nature to her tranquillity.”</p>

<p>In the interim between the departure and return
of his messengers to the Kaffer chief, he fell in with
a horde of wild Hottentots whom he denominates
Gonaquas. A small party of them arrived at his
camp during the night, and on awaking in the morning
he saw himself with surprise surrounded by
about twenty strange savages. They were accompanied
by their chief, who advanced in a polite manner
to pay his respects to the traveller, while the
women, at once curious and timid, followed close
behind, adorned with all their ornaments. Their
bodies, the greater part of which was naked, were
all newly anointed and sprinkled with red powder,
which exhaled an agreeable perfume; while their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
faces had been painted in a variety of fashions.
Each came, in the manner of the East, bringing or
bearing a present. From one he received a number
of ostrich’s eggs, a lamb from a second, while a
third presented him with a quantity of milk in baskets.
These baskets, woven with exquisite ingenuity
with fine reeds or roots, are of so close a texture,
that they may be used in carrying water. The chief’s
present consisted of a handful of ostrich feathers of
rare beauty, which Le Vaillant, to show how highly
he valued them, immediately fixed in his hat, instead
of his own plume. He then, in return, laid before
the old chief, whose name was Haabas, several
pounds of tobacco, which the Gonaqua at once distributed
in equal portions among his people, reserving
merely his own share, which did not exceed any
other person’s, for himself. Other gifts, highly
valued by savages, such as tinder-boxes, knives,
beads, and bracelets, were added to the tobacco, and
diffused universal joy among the tribe.</p>

<p>Among the women there was a girl of sixteen,
who, by the pleasure with which she seemed to regard
his person, particularly attracted the attention
of Le Vaillant. Considered as an African she might
be pronounced beautiful, and her form, which would
have tempted the pencil of an Albano, possessed all
those amorous contours which we admire in the
Graces. Our traveller appears to have been in general
but little susceptible of the charms of women;
but the beautiful Gonaqua quickly caused him to feel
that when accompanied by a desire to please, female
attractions are everywhere irresistible, and to express
his admiration he bestowed upon the savage
beauty the name of Narina, which, in the Hottentot
idiom, signifies “a flower.” Presents, it may be
easily imagined, were not spared in this instance.
The riches of his camp were in her power,&mdash;shawls,
necklaces, girdles, every ornament which his European
taste loved to contemplate on the female
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
form, was lavished on Narina, who, in the intoxicating
delight of the moment, scarcely knew whether
she was in heaven or earth. She felt her arms, her
feet, her head; and the touch of her dress and ornaments
caused fresh pleasure every moment. He then
produced a small mirror, more faithful than the lake
or stream which had hitherto served for this purpose,
and put the finishing stroke to the picture by
showing her her own image reflected from its surface.
His days now passed in one uninterrupted
series of feasts, visits, dances, amusements of every
kind. Nothing could have been more favourable to
his views of studying Hottentot manners; but with
respect to his ulterior design of penetrating far into
the solitudes of the desert, the case was different,
for his followers contracted in these Circean bowers
a disease from which their chief himself, perhaps,
was not altogether exempt; that is, an effeminate
aversion to fatigue, a secret repugnance to toil, and,
what was still worse, the habit of viewing dangers
in the light thrown over them by an enamoured
fancy, which distorts even more powerfully than the
mirage of the desert.</p>

<p>It was now three weeks since the departure of
his messengers for Kaffer-land, and he began to entertain
apprehensions for their safety. His attendants,
who partook of the same fears, became more
than ever averse to advance eastward, and, as he was
quickly informed by Klaas, began to concert among
themselves various schemes of desertion. The
camp at this period was stationed near a river, on the
rich banks of which his oxen were turned out to
graze, under the care of several Hottentots, who
were kept by their fear of the Kaffers in a strict attention
to their duty. One day, when Le Vaillant
was accidentally detained in his tent, a messenger
from the herdsmen arrived in breathless haste, to
announce the fearful intelligence that a party of the
enemy was approaching, and had already reached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
the opposite side of the river. Klaas and four fusileers
were immediately despatched to reconnoitre,
while the traveller called out and examined his forces
and his arms, and prepared to give the Kaffers a
warm reception should their intentions be found to
be hostile; but it was shortly discovered that they
had been invited to his camp by his envoys, whom
they had accordingly accompanied on their return.</p>

<p>Our traveller had with laudable patience acquired
a knowledge of the Hottentot language, but the
people who now thronged his camp spoke a different
dialect, not one word of which could he conjecture
the meaning. But the languages of savages are easy
in proportion as they are simple and poor, and the
acquisition of Greek or Arabic would probably cost
more pains and study than would render a man master
of half the uncultivated languages of the world.
It was not long, therefore, before he learned to disentangle,
as it were, the intertwisted sounds which
re-echoed around him, and to assign a meaning to
them. The Kaffers employed much gesticulation
and grimace in speaking, which aided him, likewise,
in divining their thoughts; and he soon began to
entertain reasonable hopes that an interpreter might
not always be necessary in his intercourse with this
lively people.</p>

<p>He imagined that his firearms, and the skill with
which he made use of them, inspired the Kaffers
with wonder; but he was no doubt mistaken. His
fancy placed him among those simple tribes described
by early travellers and navigators, to whom
our weapons were utterly unknown; while the
savages who were now his guests had frequently
fought hand to hand with the colonists, and not only
beheld their firearms, but learned, at the expense
of their blood, how destructive they were. This
illusion, however, appears to have afforded him
pleasure, and he honestly cherished it; and as no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
injury can arise from it to the reader, it will have
been sufficient to allude to it thus briefly.</p>

<p>The history of his intercourse with this people
affords a striking example of the incalculable benefits
which one civilized man, who possessed courage to
make the experiment, might confer upon a wild
nation, whose Menû or Manco Capæ he would thus
become. For genius the Kaffers are decidedly superior
to the Hottentots; and if the picture which
Le Vaillant draws of them be correct, it would require
no very extraordinary impulse to launch them
into the career of civilization. He saw them, however,
but for a moment, as it were; for not long
after their arrival, it was discovered that several
half-castes, or bastards, as they are termed at the
Cape, had been commissioned by the colonists to
insinuate themselves into his camp, for the purpose
of discovering whether or not he was entering into
an alliance with the Kaffers. This, at least, was the
interpretation which, after all the information he
could obtain, he was induced to put upon the matter;
but, like Rousseau, he seems to have amused himself
with the idea that spies were continually placed upon
his movements, and by this hypothesis he explained
many little events resulting much less from design
than from a fortuitous concourse of circumstances.
Still, the poor Kaffers, who had suffered grievously
by the Dutch, fully participated in his alarm, and
made a precipitate retreat into their own country,
but not before they had given him a pressing invitation
to follow them.</p>

<p>Upon considering the state of the camp, and the
inclinations of his people, it was judged imprudent
to attempt against their will to lead them away
farther from the colony; and therefore, selecting
from among them a small number of the bravest,
and leaving the remainder under the care of Swanspoel,
he departed on his long-desired journey into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
Kaffer-land. Upon quitting the encampment they
ascended the banks of the Great Fish River, and
having forded its stream, entered Kaffer-land, moving
in a north-easterly direction. The whole plain was
covered with mimosa-trees, which, as Burckhardt
observes, cast but a scanty shade. They were,
therefore, greatly exposed to the heat of the sun,
which was now intense. After marching for several
days in this manner through a country which had
once been inhabited, but was deserted now, and
abandoned to the wild beasts, fires at night, deserted
kraal, gardens overrun with weeds, and fields, the
culture of which had recently been interrupted, inspired
the belief that some half-stationary, half-wandering
hordes must be in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The fatigue of the journey, united with a scarcity
of water, began at length to cause the luxuries of
the camp and the neighbourhood of the Great Fish
River to be regretted; but although Le Vaillant himself
evidently shared to a certain degree in these
regrets, he was still unwilling to relinquish his enterprise
before he caught a single glimpse of the
Kaffers. At length a small party was discovered,
whose dread of the whites equalled at least the
terror with which they themselves inspired the pusillanimous
Hottentots. From these men Le Vaillant
learned that the greater part of the nation had
retreated far into the interior, and as his imagination,
at this time, seems to have exaggerated every difficulty
and danger, for he was weary of the journey,
he gladly seized upon the first excuse for relinquishing
his enterprise, and returned with all possible
celerity to his camp.</p>

<p>All his thoughts and wishes now pointed towards
the Cape. Narina and the friendly Gonaquas in vain
exerted their influence. The desert had lost its
charms. For the moment he was weary of travelling.
However, not to encounter in vain the fatigue
of a long journey, he formed the design of verging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
a little to the north of his former route, through the
immense solitudes of the Sneuw Bergen. The caravan,
therefore, quitted the vicinity of the sea, and
proceeded towards the west through forests of mimosa-trees,
which were then in full flower, and imparted
all the charms of summer to the landscape.
The extreme silence of the nights during this part
of the journey was sublime. All the functions of
life seemed for the time to be suspended; except
that, at intervals, the roaring of the lion resounded
through the forests, startling the echoes, and according
to the interpretation of the fancy, hushing the
whole scene with terror.</p>

<p>At length, on the 3d of January, 1782, he discovered
in the north-west the formidable summits of
the Sneuw Bergen, which, though surrounded on all
sides by burning plains, it being in those southern
latitudes the height of summer, bore still upon its
sides long ridges of snow. Prodigious herds of
antelopes, amounting to more than fifty thousand in
number, now crossed their route, driven by insufferable
heat and drought towards the north. The
scenery every league became more dreary. Wastes
of sand, rocks piled upon each other, chasms, precipices,
barrenness, sublimity, but no pasturage; and
men in want of the necessaries of life regard as insipid
whatever refuses to minister to their wants.
Thus we can account for the little interest with
which the sight of the Sneuw Bergen inspired Le
Vaillant, who would otherwise appear to have been
constitutionally deprived of that masculine energy
which impels us rather to rejoice than be depressed
at the sight of steril and desolate mountains, seldom
trodden but by the brave, and seeming to have
been expressly thrown up by nature as a rampart
upon which freedom might successfully struggle
against the oppressors of mankind. This is the true
source of that indescribable delight with which we
all tread upon mountain soil. A secret instinct seems
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
to whisper to the heart the original design, if it may
be said without impiety, with which those inexpugnable
fastnesses were fashioned by the hand of
God. “Here,” say we to ourselves, “here at least
we may be free;” and we look down from these arid
heights with scorn upon the possessors of the fattest
pastures, if the mark of tyranny, like that of the
Beast in the Apocalypse, is set upon the soil.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant’s enthusiasm, which greatly depended
upon the state of his animal spirits, was now evaporating
rapidly. His care and circumspection were
likewise proportionably diminished, and, in consequence,
the want of provisions and water was frequently
experienced. To give a keener edge to
these calamities and privations, it was rumoured
among his followers that the recesses of the snowy
mountains afforded a retreat to numerous Bushmans
or banditti, men whom necessity or inclination had
arrayed in opposition to the laws, and those who
lived under their protection. Every privation was
therefore borne with greater impatience. They considered
themselves as persons wantonly exposed to
danger by the caprice of their leader; hence his authority
was daily less and less respected. Nevertheless,
he drew near the mountains, and climbing
up with difficulty to the summit of one of their
peaks, enjoyed the wide prospect it afforded. This
satisfied his curiosity, more particularly as three
men, supposed to be bandits, were discovered among
the ravines, but made their escape at their approach.
A few days afterward one of these fierce robbers
was killed in an attempt to murder one of the Hottentots
of the escort.</p>

<p>The want of water, which they had already begun
to experience, continued to increase as they advanced.
The oxen, like the men, suffered extremely,
and several of them dropped down, and
were unable to rise again. The feet of the dogs
were exceedingly lacerated; they limped along painfully,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
and with the greatest exertion. In one word,
every man and animal in the camp required repose;
and with inexpressible joy they at length saw the
day of their arrival at the Cape, which put an end to
the toils and sufferings of sixteen months.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant had not yet satisfied his locomotive
passion, and had, indeed, notwithstanding the interest
which his adventures inspire, seen but little of
Africa. He now amused himself with visiting the
various districts of the colony, and, among other
spots, the extreme point of the promontory, which
opposes its rocky snout to the eternal storms and
waves of the Southern Ocean. Here, as with a
sombre melancholy, he viewed the constant succession
of the billows, which, confused and foaming
under the influence of the winds, hurled themselves
against the cliffs, a depression of soul came over
him, and he compared the phenomenon before him
to the life of man, and the annihilation which, according
to his creed, succeeds it. This miserable
dogma, the offspring of insane reasoning, and a distrust
in the power or goodness of the Divinity, was
at that period in dispute among the sophists of
Europe; but I pity the man who could make so
bestial a creed the companion of his soul amid the
vast solitudes of the desert, where we might expect
that the very winds of heaven would have winnowed
away so vile a chaff, and rendered back its native
whiteness and purity to the mind.</p>

<p>Returning to Cape Town, he began, but with less
enthusiasm than on the former occasion, his preparations
for a second journey into the interior.
Experience, he imagined, had enabled him to improve
upon his former plans. He had seen the
country, he had studied its inhabitants. Had he not
laid the foundation for almost certain success? The
result showed how dim, how bounded, how little to
be depended upon is human foresight.</p>

<p>His followers were now more numerous than formerly:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
eighteen men, one woman, three horses,
thirteen dogs, three milch cows, eleven goats, and
fifty-two oxen. With this train he departed from
Saldanha Bay, June 15th, 1782, directing his course
towards the north, along the western coast of Africa.
During the early part of the journey, in the district
of the Twenty-four Rivers, he found the prodigious
nests of the Termites or white ant, which, though
inferior in dimensions to those described by other
travellers, were yet four feet in height. These ants,
which are accounted a delicacy by the Chensu Karir,
a wandering people of the Deccan, are likewise
eaten by the Hottentots, who seem to regard them
with a more favourable eye even than locusts, which
are, however, highly esteemed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that, in pursuance of the advice
of his Cape friends, he had set out in the rainy
season, the party had not advanced far before the
want of water was experienced. The men and oxen
suffered extremely, but the dogs were still more
severely afflicted, and several of them, after exhibiting
symptoms of their approach to a state bordering
upon hydrophobia, ran off into the desert, where
they perished, or relapsed into their original wildness.
The party was in this position when Le Vaillant,
whose mind was tortured by the most gloomy forebodings,
was startled from his reveries by the sharp
cry of a bird which was passing over his head. It
was a mountain duck, which, he doubted not, was
proceeding towards a spring. He therefore put his
horse to the gallop, and earnestly pursuing the flight
of the bird with his eye, had very quickly the satisfaction
of observing it alight upon a great rock,
where it disappeared. Persuaded that it had stopped
to drink, he clambered up the rock, and found in fact
a large basin, or hollow in the rock, filled with water,
in which the duck was gayly swimming about and
amusing itself. He had not the ingratitude to fire
at it, but he frightened it away, in the hope that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
not having sufficiently quenched its thirst, it might
fly to another cistern within sight; but in this he
was disappointed. They now laid up a provision of
water for several days, and having allowed all the
cattle to quench their thirst, proceeded on their
journey. During those excessive droughts, it was
curious, when a shower came on, to behold the contrivance
of the animals: observing that whatever
water fell upon the sands was immediately absorbed
and lost, while the quantity with which their own
bodies were drenched ran down in little tread-like
streams over their sides, they drew near to each
other, and by applying their mouths to those diminutive
currents, thus succeeded in quenching their excruciating
thirst. I am surprised that, in the tremendous
extremities to which our traveller and his
followers were reduced by want of water, they
never had recourse to a method which, disgusting
and terrible as it may seem, has, I believe, been successfully
tried for quenching thirst by other travellers,
as well as by certain tribes of savages; I mean,
to drink the blood of the animals they slaughtered.
Man has no doubt a natural repugnance to such expedients,
but may yield, under the pressure of imperious
necessity, to whatever means, short of injustice,
Providence may afford him of preserving life.</p>

<p>Upon arriving, after extraordinary privations and
fatigue, upon the banks of the Elephant’s River, they
indeed found water in abundance; but there was no
pasture for the cattle, not even under the shade of
the mimosas and willows which bordered the stream.
All was burnt up. They proceeded farther inland,
therefore, in search of verdure, and arrived on the
banks of the Koïgnas, where they encamped upon a
spot called the “Bat’s Rock.” From the fresh footmarks
of the lion in the sand, they knew that there
were enemies in the neighbourhood, and accordingly
were more than ordinarily cautious in keeping watch,
and in the kindling of their night-fires. But,&mdash;</p>

<p>for no sooner had the fires begun to blaze, than there
issued forth from the hollows of the rocks myriads
of bats, which, flittering hither and thither, struck
against their faces, and stunned them with their obscene
cries, until, no longer able to endure their
clamour, they struck their tents and decamped. Virgil
probably derived the idea of his famous description
of the Harpies from some such adventure as
this; for he had travelled a good deal in the Grecian
islands, where bats, I believe, are numerous:</p>

<p>Le Vaillant, who had a partiality for adventure,
was here engaged in one which I must describe at
some length. Leaving the greater number of his
people encamped on the banks of the Elephant
River, he had descended with a small detachment to
the seashore. Here a whale was found, from which
the Hottentots drew several skins of oil. The traveller,
having been disappointed in his expectations
of meeting with elephants on the right bank of the
stream, concluded, with some degree of probability,
that they had crossed the river, and taken refuge on
the opposite side: he was therefore desirous of following
them. But he was near the mouth of the
river, which, at all times wide and rapid, had been
exceedingly increased by the late rains, and now presented
a formidable appearance. Unhappily, he was
incapable of swimming, and for constructing a raft
there was no time. After much consideration, therefore,
it was resolved to attempt the stream in a novel
mode. The trunk of a fallen tree was selected; the
tent, with the garments of the Hottentots, was
fastened upon its centre, the oil-skins at each end;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
while Le Vaillant himself, having suspended his
watch and powder-flasks about his neck, and tied all
their fowling-pieces on his shoulders, got astride
upon the tree as soon as it was afloat. The Hottentots,
having fastened strips of leather to the end of
the trunk, then jumped into the water, and pushed
off from the shore. They were four in number, and
it was agreed that two should tow the tree along,
while the other two pushed it forward from behind,
taking these different offices in turn. As long as
they remained in smooth water their progress was
rapid. Nothing could appear more easy than their
undertaking. They laughed, they jested with each
other, and already thought themselves on the opposite
shore. But their triumph was premature: for
they had no sooner entered the current than the
tree became unmanageable; now pitching forward
upon the swimmers, now recoiling with invincible
force against those who laboured to impel it from
behind; dragging the former after it, submerging the
latter in the waves. No jests were now heard.
Every limb was plied, every nerve strained, to force
a way through the impetuous current; every man
exerted himself to the utmost; but the river rushed
along with irresistible violence, and instead of
making way towards the shore, they saw themselves
hurried down by the stream towards the sea, where
inevitable death awaited them. Meanwhile Le Vaillant
perceived with dismay that their strength began
to fail them. They breathed short, their strokes became
irregular, their efforts grew fainter and fainter;
yet they tugged desperately at the tree, apparently
resolved at least to perish at their posts, and to share
the fate of him whom they could not save. Still
they drew nearer and nearer to the sea, and their
hopes diminished in proportion. Observing this, the
two men who had been placed in the rear sprang forward,
and by their united strength endeavoured to
force along the trunk. At length Le Vaillant thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
he perceived a diminution in the violence of the current,
and this discovery being communicated to the
swimmers, they redoubled their efforts, and in a few
minutes one of them found that he could touch the
bottom. This he announced by a loud cry of joy,
which was re-echoed by the others. They now began
to recover their tranquillity, and pushing forward
with vigour, were quickly landed on the shore.
Here they joyously kindled an immense fire, and
having along with them a small quantity of brandy,
they drank it, dried themselves, and next day departed
on their return to the camp.</p>

<p>Here fresh troubles awaited the traveller. His
oxen were dying of hunger and fatigue; his followers
were discouraged; even his own resolution was
shaken. But the shame of succumbing to surmountable
difficulties,&mdash;of entertaining a base fear
of dangers which other men had braved,&mdash;of returning,
in fact, baffled and defeated to the Cape, urged
him forward, and he accordingly struck his tents,
and moved once more towards the north. Courage
and intrepidity are of vast importance in every circumstance
of life, in none more so than in the circumstances
in which an African traveller is placed;
but these virtues will not draw wagons, or silence
the murmurs of the appetite when clamouring for
food. Le Vaillant was prepared to endure, and he
cheerfully abandoned his chariots in the desert when
oxen were wanting to drag them along; but he
abandoned at the same time much of that merchandise
with which he was accustomed to purchase the
friendship and aid of the savage, and from that moment
all rational hope of traversing the whole continent,
from the Cape of Good Hope to the Mediterranean,
vanished. He continued his journey, however,
from the laudable desire of performing what
he could, though what he had projected might prove
impracticable.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant’s difficulties were far from being imaginary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
Thirst, that most maddening of human privations,
was now felt once more, and the parched
herbage afforded neither nourishment nor cooling
juices to the cattle. All their hopes now centred
in those thunderstorms which, at certain seasons of
the year, are common in southern Africa, and the
jocular extravagance of Aristophanes, who represents
men as cloud-worshippers, was now scarcely
an exaggeration: for both our traveller and his followers
almost bowed down in religious adoration to
every cloud that sailed aloft in the blue firmament,
and seemed to announce a tempest. At length vast
masses of black vapour began to gather together in
heaps over their heads, and to spread in sombre files
along the sky. Flashes of lightning were perceived
on the edge of the horizon; and all the forerunners
of a storm successively presented themselves to
their delighted senses.</p>

<p>It came at length. “I heard,” says the traveller,
“the sound of some large drops, the happy precursors
of an abundant shower. All my senses, dilated
at once by joy and gladness, unfolded themselves to
the vital influence. I crept out from under my covering,
and lying down on my back, with my mouth
open, I received with delight the drops which
chanced to fall on me, every one of which seemed
to be a refreshing balm to my parched lips and
tongue. I repeat it, the purest pleasure of my whole
life was what I tasted in that delicious moment,
which had been purchased by so many sighs and
hours of anguish. It was not long before the shower
poured down from all sides; during three hours it
fell in torrents, seeming in noise to rival the thunder,
which all the while continued roaring over our
heads. My people ran about in all directions through
the storm, seeking for one another, with triumphant
mutual congratulations for the drenching they experienced;
for they felt themselves revived; and
appeared as if desirous of inflating their bodies that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
they might thus offer a larger surface to the rain,
and imbibe a greater quantity of it. For my own
part, I enjoyed so delicious a pleasure in soaking
myself like them, that, in order the longer to preserve
the refreshing coolness, I would not at first
change my dress, which I was at length, however,
compelled to do by the cold.”</p>

<p>On the following night one of his followers disappeared,
a circumstance which, as they were now in
the country of the Bushmen, to whom it was possible
the fugitive might betray them, was a source of
peculiar uneasiness. However, after causing considerable
alarm among the whole party, each of
whom indulged a different conjecture, the man returned,
announcing the discovery of a Hottentot
kraal at no great distance. Towards this spot the
whole party immediately proceeded, again and again
quenching their thirst on the way, in reservoirs of
crystal purity, which had been formed in the hollows
of the rocks by the recent storm. Arrived, Le
Vaillant found that the horde of which they had
come in search was fortunately that of a man to
whom he had been strongly recommended by a
friend at the Cape. He was received with hospitality.
The chief, flattered by the visit, undertook
for a time to become his guide; and having generously
and successfully exerted himself for the recovery
of the chariots abandoned in the desert, and
performed numerous other kind offices for his guest,
the caravan was once more put in motion.</p>

<p>In the evening, on their arriving at the halting-place,
Le Vaillant observed with surprise a tent,
guarded by Hottentots, pitched a little in advance of
him; and upon inquiry, found that it belonged to a
M. Pinard, one of the individuals he had rejected at
Cape Town. A presentiment of evil immediately
flashed upon his mind. He regarded the tent with
inquietude. Misfortune seemed to perch upon its
summit. And in the sequel he learned, with vexation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
how well-founded his apprehensions had been. However,
for the moment, the encounter seemed to offer
nothing but pleasure. Pinard was the bearer of letters
from some of his dearest friends, and to a man
of sound feelings a person thus armed is irresistible;
but to an evil disposition the very counterfeiting of
goodness is too painful long to be endured. Our
Dutch adventurer, whose wealth chiefly consisted in
brandy, a commodity which experience had taught
him was omnipotent with Hottentots, seemed to consider
his casks as too weighty, and habitually exerted
himself in diminishing the burden. In one
word, he was a drunkard; and having indulged himself
with an extraordinary dose on the very evening
of Le Vaillant’s arrival, the brandy-casks were
abandoned to the Hottentots, and in a short time
both camps were a scene of wild revelry and intoxication.</p>

<p>To those who have observed the manners of savages,
whether in our own country or in the woods, it must
be well known that the Circean transformations are
not fabulous. Brandy has everywhere the power of
changing men into beasts, and into beasts which are
the more dangerous, inasmuch as they retain, under
their new forms, a memory morbidly retentive, which
seems to rejoice at its escape from the restraints of
reason. Le Vaillant’s followers, having nothing to
fear from the reproaches of decorum, now plunged
into the delights of drunkenness with an avidity
which appeared as if intended as an imputation on
his want of generosity; for they considered his prudent
economy as a niggardly doling out of a necessary
of life, brandy being by them regarded in that
light. Though he had given orders that the caravan
should be put in motion at the break of day, the
men, with the exception of Klaas and two or three
of his companions, were all furiously intoxicated before
the oxen could be yoked to the wagons. Even
old Swanspoel, who had hitherto conducted himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
with prudence, yielded to the seduction, and endeavouring
with reeling steps to mount the wagon, his
foot slipped, and he rolled under the wheel, which immediately
passed over his body. Le Vaillant, who
loved the old man, feared he had been crushed to
pieces; but it was afterward found, upon examination,
that he merely had two ribs broken; though this fracture
caused him such terrible anguish on the road, that
he conjured his master, with clasped hands, to blow
out his brains with one of his pistols. As our traveller
was utterly ignorant of surgery, it was necessary
to leave the treatment of the fracture to nature.
The pain, meanwhile, was excruciating, and
in order to blunt its point, the old Hottentot continued
to drink immoderate quantities of brandy, which,
as it failed to kill him, obtained, in the sequel, the
honour of a cure. In six weeks he was able to resume
his occupations.</p>

<p>At length, after enduring his company with a patience
which it were easier to praise than to imitate,
he separated from Pinard. He now discovered another
remarkable person, a sailor, who, having deserted
from the Dutch navy, had retired into the wilderness,
where he had adopted, as far as possible,
the manners of a savage; married several wives, by
whom he had numerous children, and laid the foundation
of what might have proved a powerful horde.
But this individual affords an example of how difficult
it is for the civilized man, of whatever rank he
may be, to retrograde; for, although possessed of
considerable wealth, and, which is still sweeter, of
independence, and the germs of power, he yearned
after that society in which he must always be as nothing;
and afterward, upon Le Vaillant’s obtaining
him his pardon, deserted his harem, returned with
his children to the colony, married, and sunk into
the dull lethargy of ordinary Dutch life.</p>

<p>This man, whose name was Shoenmaker, became
our traveller’s guide through the neighbouring regions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
They continued still to advance towards the
north, passed through the countries of the Lesser
and Greater Namaquas, and arrived at length in the
district in which the giraffe is found. Here all his
ardour for the chase was at once revived by the
sight of one of these animals’ skins, which, in one
of the kraals he visited, served as a covering to a
hut. A few days afterward, while he was admiring
the nest of the constructor bird, one of his Namaqua
guides came in great haste to inform him that
he had just seen a giraffe browsing upon the leaves
of a mimosa-tree. “In an instant,” says the traveller,
“I mounted my horse, being intoxicated with
joy, and causing Bernfry” (a deserter from the colony
whom he encountered in the desert) “to follow
my example, I hurried with my dogs towards the
mimosa-tree. The giraffe was no longer there. We
saw her crossing the plain towards the west, and
put spurs to our horses in order to overtake her.
She then got into an easy trot, but did not seem at
all hurried. We galloped after her, firing at her
from time to time; but she insensibly gained ground
upon us in such a manner that, after continuing the
chase for three hours, we were compelled to stop,
our horses being out of breath, and we immediately
lost sight of her.” He now found himself alone, at
a distance from his camp; and, what was worse,
knew not how to shape his course towards it.
Meantime he suffered considerably from thirst and
hunger; but having killed and cooked some birds,
his wants were soon satisfied, and he had leisure for
reflection. In the midst of his reveries he was found
by some of his attendants, and conducted back to
the camp. Next day the hunting of the giraffe was
continued with equally bad success. On the third
day seven of these animals were discovered, and
immediately pursued by his dogs. “Six of them,”
says he, “went off together; but the seventh, cut off
by my pack, took a different direction. Bernfry, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
happened just then to be on foot, immediately
vaulted into the saddle, and set off in pursuit of the
former. I pursued the latter at all speed; but in
spite of the swiftness of my horse, she gained upon
me so much that, on turning a small eminence, I
lost sight of her, and gave up the chase. My dogs,
however, had quickly overtaken her, and pressed
her so closely that she was compelled to stop in her
own defence. From the place where I was I heard
them give tongue with all their might; but as their
voices all appeared to come from the same spot, I
conjectured that they had got the animal into some
corner, and I again pushed forwards. As soon as I
had turned the hill, I in fact discovered her surrounded
by the dogs, and making desperate efforts
to drive them off by heavy kicks. In a moment I
was on my feet, and a single shot from my carbine
brought her to the earth. Enchanted with my victory,
I returned to call my people about me, that they
might skin and cut up the animal. As I was looking
about, I observed Klaas Bastard eagerly making
signals to me, which I could not at first comprehend;
but on turning towards the direction in which
he pointed, I perceived a giraffe assailed by my dogs
under an ebony-tree. Supposing it to be another
animal, I ran towards it; but it was the same, which
had risen again, and just as I was about to fire a
second time dropped down dead.</p>

<p>“Who could have believed that a conquest like
this would have excited me to a transport almost
approaching to madness! Pains, fatigues, cruel
privations, uncertainty as to the future, disgust
sometimes as to the past&mdash;all these recollections
and feelings fled at the sight of this new prey. I
could not satisfy my desire to contemplate it. I
measured its enormous height. I looked from the
animal to the instrument which had destroyed it.
I called and recalled my people about me. Although
we had combated together the largest and the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
dangerous animals, it was I alone who had killed the
giraffe. I was now able to add to the riches of natural
history; I was now able to destroy the romance
which attached to this animal, and to establish a
truth. My people congratulated me on my triumph.
Bernfry alone was absent; but he came at last, walking
at a slow pace, and holding his horse by the
bridle. He had fallen from his seat, and injured his
shoulder. I heard not what he said to me. I saw
not that he wanted assistance; I spoke to him only
of my victory. He showed me his shoulder; I
showed him my giraffe. I was intoxicated, and I
should not have thought even of my own wounds.”</p>

<p>He now paid a visit to the Kameniqua horde.
His camp abounded with provisions; but his people,
who had for some time been accustomed to the
company of women, drew so many of these fair ones
about them, that it was feared nothing else would be
thought of. However, Le Vaillant was obliged to
wink at this irregularity, to prevent the desertion of
the whole body, and his complaisance, as it happened,
drew after it no evil consequences. In proceeding
through the country of the Greater Namaquas
he arrived at a kraal, which had been thrown
by the death of its chief into the utmost confusion,
and, upon his making strenuous exertions to restore
order, was himself elected chief. This dignity, however,
he delegated to another, and had the satisfaction
of observing, at his departure, tranquillity and
good order taking the place of discord and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Our traveller now drew near the country of the
most extraordinary people which he ever met with
during his travels. These were the Hoozwanas, a
nation by the Hottentots confounded with the Bushmen,
but which, in the opinion of Le Vaillant, differed
from them entirely; as while the latter were
a collection of vagabonds from all nations, living in
holes and caves, and subsisting chiefly by plunder,
the former were as nearly as possible homogeneous.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
They differed in a remarkable manner from the Hottentots
in being enterprising and brave, and enjoyed
among their neighbours so great a reputation for
these qualities, that their very name was a talisman
which struck terror into all who heard it. For this
reason Le Vaillant could not, in this instance, pursue
his ordinary practice of sending forward native
ambassadors or agents to prepare him a welcome
reception among the horde. At the bare mention
of the Hoozwanas his followers and allies felt their
blood curdle with fear, and not only refused to advance
before him, but endeavoured likewise to dissuade
him from the attempt, which, in their opinion,
could terminate no otherwise than fatally.</p>

<p>Le Vaillant, who remembered their vain terrors in
the case of the Kaffers, was thoroughly convinced
that their present apprehensions had no better foundation.
His wagons and a considerable number of
his attendants had been left encamped on the banks
of the Gariep, or Orange River; he was now resolved
rather to dismiss the remainder, and proceed
alone, than shrink from his undertaking; and Klaas
and five of his companions voluntarily engaging to
undertake the expedition, he informed the remainder
that they were at liberty to depart, their services
being no longer required. But if they were afraid
to advance, to retreat seemed no less terrible; so
that, whipped into enterprise by their very fears,
they one and all announced their readiness to follow
the fortunes of their chief.</p>

<p>He therefore proceeded towards the north; but,
while he despised the fears of his Hottentots, and
somewhat doubted the correctness of their representations,
he nevertheless considered it prudent to
move along in a guarded manner, seeing that every
thicket might contain an enemy. For some days
silence and solitude prevailed around. There appeared
no traces of man; or if any human beings
ever started up in the distance, it was only to flit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
immediately away like phantoms among the rocks
and sandhills, leaving behind them strong doubts of
the reality of their apparition. Meanwhile their
route led them over a burning desert, covered with
saline dust, which, lifted up by the winds, entered
their eyes and almost maddened them. The vehement
heat of the sun, from which no contrivance
could wholly shield them, likewise began to disorder
their senses and their imaginations; so that, like
mariners in a calenture, they saw mountains, green
fields, or groves, or running streams, where in reality
there was nothing but a prodigious plateau of scorching
sand.</p>

<p>At length, upon halting in the evening, they observed,
as the darkness came on, several vast fires
among the peaks of the distant hills, which they
doubted not belonged to the Hoozwanas. With this
discovery all their old terrors returned. The watch,
therefore, it may be easily imagined, was vigilant
that night; and as soon as the morning appeared,
Le Vaillant, taking a few of his attendants along
with him, proceeded to reconnoitre. The scene
which now presented itself was desolate beyond description.
Steep ridges of barren rock, rising from
a plain of sand, and broken into ravines, gullies,
chasms, precipices; beyond a few stunted, miserable
plants, no signs of life; while a dead silence brooded
over all, save when the wild daman sent forth its
shrill cry from among the rocks, or when the vulture
or the eagle screamed aloft over their heads.</p>

<p>After a fatiguing march through these savage
mountains, they reached a slender stream which
flowed from a narrow opening in the rocks, and discovered
upon its banks a small Hoozwana encampment.
No persons but a few women were visible;
but upon their uttering a cry of alarm, the men immediately
rushed out, armed with bows and arrows,
and taking their families along with them, retreated,
and took up their position on a small eminence commanding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
their huts. Failing to make himself understood
by the ordinary signs of friendship and
good-will, he advanced towards their huts, deposited
a quantity of beads and tobacco, and then retired to
observe their movements. When they considered
him at a sufficient distance, they returned, and upon
examining the presents exhibited tokens of extraordinary
satisfaction; but upon the approach of the
traveller a second time they again retreated, though
to a smaller distance than before. He now resolved
to endeavour, by going forward alone and unarmed,
to remove their apprehensions; and, taking in his
hand a new present, he proceeded towards them.
This manœuvre succeeded. One of the savages immediately
came to meet him; and addressing him in
the Hottentot language, demanded who he was, and
whence he came. Le Vaillant replied that he was
a traveller, desirous of examining the country, and,
if possible, of finding friends in it. The man then
came up to him. The Hottentots likewise drew
near, and entered into conversation with the stranger,
who, they found, belonged to their nation. Observing
that no evil had befallen their friend, the remainder
of the horde now joined the group, and were
rendered, by a few trifling presents, as friendly and
peaceful in their deportment as the least ferocious
of the Hottentot tribes.</p>

<p>The manners of this people were remarkable.
They remained in their rocky fastnesses, to which
they were habitually confined by the hostility of
their neighbours, as long as the gazelles, white ants,
or locusts, which abound in those districts, afforded
them provisions. When a scarcity happened, however,
then wo to the surrounding nations. They
stood upon the lofty summits of their mountains,
and casting their eyes around, selected for the scene
of their desperate foray the region which presented
the richest aspect. Flocks and herds were seized,
and killed upon the spot, or driven to the mountains,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
as circumstances required; but, unless when attacked
and put in actual peril, the Hoozwanas abstained
from shedding human blood. Their appearance,
when engaged in war, was peculiarly striking.
Naked, excepting that small portion of the body
which instinct alone teaches man to conceal, they
yet wore a species of helmet or war-cap on their
heads, upon which there was a crest formed of the
hyena’s mane. Though considerably below the
middle size, their well-formed active bodies, and
daring character, the evidence of which was deeply
written in their countenance, admirably fitted them
for warriors. In peace, however, no men could exhibit
more gentleness, or regard for strangers; and
our traveller observes, that had he attempted the
traversing the African continent from the Cape to
the Mediterranean, he should have chiefly founded
his hopes of success on the active, faithful character
of the Hoozwanas.</p>

<p>The Hoozwana women exhibited that peculiar
conformation of the nates which is generally supposed
to be a characteristic of the Hottentot race.
With the latter, however, it is the growth of years,
and commences only at a late period of life; while
in the former it is a portion of the original form
with which the infant is born, and which increases
merely in proportion as the whole body is developed.
Upon this strange projection mothers carry their
children, which, when two or three years old, stand
upon it as a footman does behind a carriage. But,
notwithstanding that they were in this respect deformed,
they possessed hands and arms of extraordinary beauty.
They wore the war-bonnet and sandals
like their husbands; but were in other respects
naked, with the exception of a small apron. A small
wooden, ivory, or tortoise-shell case hung by their
side, in which they carried their ointment; and the
tail of some small animal, fastened on a staff, served,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
instead of a pocket handkerchief, to wipe away the
dust or perspiration from their faces.</p>

<p>Having spent some time in the country of the
Hoozwanas, he bent his course towards his camp on
the Gariep, his gallant hosts serving him as guides
across the mountains. In the course of the journey
one of the oxen threw from off its back the box of
toys and cutlery, which, making a frightful clatter,
terrified the animal, which ran off roaring in a furious
manner. Le Vaillant, in endeavouring to force it
back, found himself engaged in a dangerous adventure;
for, instead of returning towards his companions,
it rushed impetuously at the horse, which,
springing suddenly aside, threw his rider and took to
flight. The ox now rushed with stooping head at
the traveller, who, having fortunately fallen with his
musket in his hand, pointed his piece, and carefully
levelling it at his enemy, fired, and shot him dead
upon the spot.</p>

<p>This accident seemed to be merely the forerunner
of that which happened immediately after his arrival
at the camp. He had crossed the Gariep with his
tents and baggage; but the oxen, never having seen
so broad a stream, could by no means whatever be
induced to attempt the passage. They resisted all
the efforts of their drivers, and even their very blows
seemed to render them more stubborn. It was
therefore determined to take them farther up the
stream, and renew their endeavours next morning.
The herdsmen, however, rendered heedless or confident
by the vicinity of the camp, fell asleep, and
allowed their fires to die away. At this moment
the Bushmen, who had been lying in wait for them,
stole quietly into the circle, and, driving off the oxen,
escaped, and before the break of day were already
far on their way towards their secret haunts.</p>

<p>Next morning, early, Le Vaillant was suddenly
awakened by Klaas, who informed him of what had
happened; and counselled him to arm a number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
his followers, and pursue the robbers. This advice
was instantly adopted. He took thirteen of the
bravest, and following the track of the oxen, which
was visible enough upon the sand, during six hours,
found that it struck off from the river. Here they
passed the night. Next morning before day they continued
the pursuit, and finding that the herd had been
divided into two parts, pursued the track of the more
numerous, not doubting that the division had been
made merely for the purpose of distracting their attention.
From a Hottentot village by which they
passed they obtained two guides, who, being perfectly
acquainted with the country, undertook to
conduct them to the hiding-places of the Bushmen.
They therefore again set forward, and after tracking
the robbers for several leagues, found that they had
crossed the river, in which they discovered the body
of one of the oxen which had been drowned in the
passage. The stream being here deep and rapid
rendered the passage both difficult and dangerous.
They, however, succeeded in gaining the opposite
shore, but what was their vexation when, having
ascended a short distance up the river, it was perceived
that the artful bandits had again crossed, and
were therefore on the other side. This manœuvre
was repeated three times, for so frequently had the
Bushmen crossed and recrossed the stream. But at
length the track was lost in the path leading to a
kraal, in which, therefore, they concluded the oxen
must be concealed.</p>

<p>The guides, fearful lest their presence among the
traveller’s attendants might occasion a war between
these bandits and their nation, here demanded permission
to remain behind during the attack upon
the kraal, and their request was unhappily complied
with. Le Vaillant himself, conceiving that darkness
would be favourable to his views, resolved to defer
the execution of his project until night. They accordingly
encamped upon the spot, and a little after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
midnight set off in the greatest silence. “Soon
afterward,” says he, “we perceived, at the distance
of about three-quarters of a league, the light of
several fires; and advancing a little farther, we
heard songs, cries of joy, and immoderate shouts of
laughter. The bandits were amusing themselves,
and making good cheer at my expense. Their
clamour, however, had one good effect; for my dogs
began to set up so loud a barking on drawing near
the kraal, that it became necessary to muzzle them,
so that but for the frightful tumult within we should
infallibly have been betrayed. I was now, therefore,
in a state of warfare with savages, and resolved
to employ against them the resources of art, should
they oppose me with superior force. The moment
not being favourable for commencing the attack, I
put it off until the break of day, and in order to conduct
it in the most advantageous manner, I intrenched
myself and my troop behind a copse, which,
by affording us an impenetrable shield against the
attacks of our enemies, would render our own
doubly terrible. The copse, in fact, was sufficiently
extensive to contain and conceal all my musketeers;
and each of us, by pushing aside or breaking off a
few branches, immediately formed a sort of porthole
through which we could fire. In this position
we patiently and silently awaited the moment for
action. The villains themselves appeared, by their
conduct, to favour our views. Their noisy merriment
died away by degrees; and at length, yielding
to fatigue, they retired into their huts to rest, and
the noise entirely ceased.</p>

<p>“The day soon appeared, when we discovered
that the position we had taken up was too far from
the kraal. Leaving our oxen, and my two horses,
ready saddled in case of a defeat, behind the bushes,
under the care of one of my people, we advanced,
therefore, and posted ourselves within gunshot of
the kraal. It was a considerable hamlet, consisting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
of not less than thirty or forty huts, and occupied
the slope of a hill, behind which a range of high
mountains swept round in the form of an amphitheatre.
Though our muskets were all loaded, it
was not my intention to commence hostilities with
the effusion of blood. I designed merely to alarm
the brigands, and by the consternation caused by a
sudden attack, to compel them to take to flight. For
this reason I commanded my followers to fire in the
air, and on no account to take aim at a single individual
unless by my express orders. I began the
assault by firing my large carbine, the report of
which, multiplied by the echoes of the neighbouring
mountains, produced a terrible noise. We had persuaded
ourselves that at the sound of this thunder
the whole horde would fly in consternation, and my
companions were preparing to augment their terrors
by a general discharge. But, to our astonishment,
not a creature appeared. It was in vain that we
fired round after round; every thing remained calm,
and I knew not what to conjecture. This security
was merely apparent. While external appearances
announced sleep and peace, every soul within was
given up to terror and confusion. But by a stratagem
to which they, no doubt, had been long accustomed,
no one wished to appear before the whole
body were armed; and it is probable that they communicated
with each other by signals. When they
were ready for battle, they all at the same moment
rushed out of their huts, and advancing with frightful
howlings towards us, let fly a cloud of arrows, which
falling far short of their mark, we still replied to
by firing over their heads. Observing that none of
their party were hurt, they began to imagine that
our muskets would not carry so far, and therefore
uniting into one body, they came on with fury. We
awaited the assault with firmness. My people, in
the mean time, called aloud to them to restore my
oxen. Whether they heard us or not I cannot determine;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
but they had now advanced so near that
their arrows fell about us in showers. I now
thought it full time to fire in earnest, and issuing
my orders to aim at their bodies, we fired several
volleys in rapid succession, and had very quickly the
satisfaction to see this numerous band of men scattered
about like emmets, flying in all directions, and
uttering fearful shrieks, which were no longer, as
at first, cries of valour and defiance, but the howlings
of despair. Their wives and children had retreated,
during the combat, to the summit of the hill, where
the oxen were grazing; and it was thither that they
now fled; whence, having rapidly collected the
cattle, they plunged down into the hollow on the
opposite side, and disappeared. Being well persuaded
that, should they once reach the defiles of
the mountains, all pursuit would be vain, I mounted
my horse, and dividing my men into two bodies,
directed one party to cut off their retreat on one
side, while I myself with the remainder should
attack them on the other. It was not many minutes
before we discovered the savages hurrying down
the hill towards a plain, in which there was a small
wood; and, in fact, the greater number of them
quickly disappeared a second time, but those who
drove the cattle were necessarily more slow, and
seeing us close upon their heels, they likewise took
to flight, leaving the oxen behind them. At this
moment my other detachment coming up, fired at
them, and stretched one of their number upon the
earth. The rest escaped.”</p>

<p>Having thus regained possession of his cattle, and
fearing he might fall into some ambush laid for him
by the savages, he hastened back to the kraal, where
he found their own herd. In lieu of one of the oxen
which had been killed and eaten, he took away a
young cow and two sheep, and hurried towards the
spot where he had left his Kameniqua guides. Here
he was shocked by a very horrible spectacle. One
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
of the men had been torn to pieces during the night,
and the other likewise had suffered severely. They
had, in fact, neglected to keep alive their fire, and
had been attacked by a lion in their sleep. Le Vaillant
caused them to be placed upon his horses, and
carried along with them; but abandoned the dying
man at the first halting-place. The other eventually
recovered.</p>

<p>Though dogged all the way by the Bushmen, he
reached his camp in safety, from whence, having
now entirely abandoned the idea of traversing the
African continent, he turned his face southwards,
and directed his course towards the Cape. His constitution
had considerably suffered during this journey,
and he suddenly began to experience unequivocal
symptoms of illness. While he was in this condition
he encountered a white family, who, having
endured signal misfortunes in the world, had succeeded
in snapping asunder the links which ordinarily
bind men to society, and were now, with a few
Hottentot servants, and a wagon which contained
all their worldly possessions, proceeding towards
Namaqua-land in search of a better fortune than
they had hitherto met with. Le Vaillant, who
could easily read indolence and inactivity in the
countenance of the father, was still deeply interested
in his fate, by an air of goodness which accompanied
the indication of those qualities; and anticipating the
consent of the owner, he bestowed upon them a small
house and ground in the vicinity, four sheep, a goat,
a dog, together with a quantity of toys and cutlery,
wherewith to purchase the friendship of the savages.
With these riches they departed on their way, blessing
the friendly hand which had enabled them to
live in comfort, and praying for the happiness of
him who, under Providence, had been the creator
of theirs.</p>

<p>He now pushed forward to the banks of the Kansi,
where his progress was put a stop to by a buinsy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
accompanied by violent fever. This disease is generally
mortal in Africa. Of this circumstance he
was perfectly aware, and accordingly from the beginning
began to fear the worst, and gave himself
up for lost. But his followers, who, with ignorance
of physic equal to his own, indulged more sanguine
hopes, requested his permission to apply the only
remedy known among them; and having obtained
his consent, applied round his neck towels dipped
in boiling milk, until the skin was nearly scalded off.
This treatment was continued during three days;
but finding no benefit from it, he abandoned the physicians,
and resolved to leave the whole to nature.
Meanwhile his condition was alarming. His throat
and tongue were so much swelled that he could
swallow nothing but a few drops of weak tea, and
at length lost entirely the power of speaking, except
by signs. The fears of his Hottentots were no less
than his own. When Klaas or Swanspoel entered
his tent, the other attendants would thrust their black
woolly heads in after them, in the expectation of
gathering from their looks whether there was still
any hope. Such was the state of the case when
several persons of the Lesser Namaqua horde arrived
in the camp, among the rest a little man, who, when
informed of the disorder of the chief, immediately
undertook his cure. Our traveller, willing to make
trial of every means within his power, permitted
the Hottentot Æsculapius to treat him as he pleased;
and had once more to endure a hot cataplasm on
his throat, which, together with a gargle of sage-juice,
formed the whole remedy. In the course of
one night his freedom of respiration and the power
of swallowing were restored, and in three days he
was well.</p>

<p>This danger being over, Le Vaillant returned to
the Cape, dismissed his Hottentots, and taking leave
of his South African friends, set sail for Europe,
July 14th, 1784. He arrived in Paris in the beginning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
of the January following, and from thenceforward
his whole life was occupied in putting his collections
in order, in compiling the account of his
travels, and in composing the various works which
he afterward published or left in MS. on the natural
history of the birds and quadrupeds of Africa.&mdash;Though
his occupations were thus simple and peaceful,
he was not able during the stormy days of the
Revolution to escape unsuspected; he was apprehended
and imprisoned in 1793, and is supposed to
have escaped the guillotine only by the fall of Robespierre.
His habitual residence during the latter part
of his life was on a small estate that he possessed at
La Noue, near Sezanne. There, when not engaged
in his literary labours, he amused himself with hunting;
and in this manner he lived during nearly thirty
years. He died on the 22d of November, 1824.
During the whole of that time he had seldom quitted
his retreat to visit Paris, except for the purpose of
seeing his works through the press. His “Travels,”
upon which his hopes of fame must chiefly rest, appear
to have occupied him nearly eleven years, the
first part having been published in 1790, and the
second in 1796. It has often been asserted, says
M. Eyriès, that these travels were compiled from
the author’s notes by Casimir Varron but this is a
mistake; he merely read the proof sheets for the
purpose of correction, Le Vaillant not being sufficiently
acquainted with the French language to enable
him to confide in his own judgment.</p>

<p>It was Le Vaillant who first made the giraffe
known in France, and the stuffed specimen in the
king’s collection is the one which was brought over
by him. His other works are, “The Natural History
of the Birds of Africa,” of the parroquet, and
of the birds of Paradise. The figures, designed
under his inspection by Barraband, are said to possess
great merit; and his scientific works occupy the
first rank among books of that kind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BELZONI">BELZONI.</h2>
</div>

<p>This able and interesting traveller, descended from
a respectable Roman family, was born at Padua,
whither his relations had many years previously removed.
Being designed by his parents for some
monastic order, he was at a very early age sent to
Rome, the original abode of his ancestors, where he
received his education, and spent the greater part
of his youth. Here the sciences would appear to
have obtained a decided preference in his mind, over
every other branch of study; particularly hydraulics,
to which he owed the reputation which he afterward
acquired in the world, and a success which was by
no means equal to his deserts. The invasion of
Italy, and the capture of Rome by the French, disturbed
the peaceful but insignificant plan of life
which he had traced out for himself. Instead of a
monk he became a traveller. Departing from Rome
in the year 1800, he for some time wandered about
the Continent, deriving his subsistence, as he himself
observes, from his own knowledge and industry,
and occasional remittances from his family, who,
though by no means wealthy, seem to have been
generously disposed to afford him a support, which
he, in a short time, no less generously refused to
accept.</p>

<p>In the year 1803 he arrived in England, where he
not long afterward married. In this country he
supported himself, as is well known, by performing
in public feats of prodigious strength, and by scientific
exhibitions; still, with a manly independence,
preferring the gaining of a precarious subsistence by
these means to the idea of draining the slender resources
of his family, or of resorting to those more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
easy but less reputable sources of gain which too
frequently employ the talents of foreigners in England.
Having remained nine years in Great Britain,
Belzoni conceived the desire of visiting the south
of Europe; and, taking his wife along with him,
travelled through Portugal, Spain, and Malta. It
seems to have been during this part of his travels
that he learned, from what he considered unexceptionable
authority, that his scientific knowledge
might be turned to good account in Egypt, where an
hydraulic machine would be of the greatest utility
in irrigating the fields, which want water only to
make them produce at any season of the year.</p>

<p>He accordingly took his passage on board of some
ship bound for Egypt, and arrived in the harbour of
Alexandria on the 9th of June, 1815. The plague,
he was informed, was now in the city, but gradually
decreasing in malignity. St. John’s day, the 24th
of June, was likewise at hand, on which it usually
ceases entirely, through the interference, as the
vulgar believe, of the saint, but in reality from the
intense heat of the sun, which has by that time
exhaled those damp miasmata which are the immediate
cause of the plague. Belzoni, who was accompanied
by his wife and a young Irish lad, named
Curtain, landed, notwithstanding the disease; and
having remained secluded in the occale, or khun,
until after the 24th, set off for Cairo. On reaching
this city, where he meant to make an offer of his
services to the pasha, to whose principal interpreter
he brought letters of recommendation, he obtained
lodgings in an old house, which from its vast size
and ruinous condition would have made a handsome
figure in one of Mrs. Ratcliffe’s romances. Though
antiquities, as he observes, were not at that time
his object, he could not refrain from visiting the
Pyramids. He accordingly accompanied an English
gentleman to the spot, where they passed the night,
and long before dawn had ascended the summit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
the highest pile, to behold the sun rise over the land
of Egypt.</p>

<p>“The scene here,” says he, “is majestic and grand
far beyond description: a mist over the plains of
Egypt formed a veil, which ascended and vanished
gradually as the sun rose, and unveiled to the view
that beautiful land, once the site of Memphis. The
distant view of the smaller pyramids on the south
marked the extension of that vast capital; while the
solemn endless spectacle of the desert, on the west,
inspired us with reverence for the all-powerful Creator.
The fertile lands on the north, with the serpentine
course of the Nile, descending towards the
sea; the rich appearance of Cairo, and its minarets,
at the foot of the Mokatam mountain, on the east;
the beautiful plain which extends from the Pyramids
to that city; the Nile, which flows magnificently
through the centre of the Sacred Valley; and the
thick groves of palm-trees under our eyes, altogether
formed a scene of which a very imperfect idea can
be given by the most elaborate description.”</p>

<p>A few days after his return to Cairo he was to
have been presented to the pasha, but on the way to
the citadel was attacked and wounded by a Turkish
soldier in such a manner that he was compelled to
defer his presentation for thirty days. Mohammed
Ali had not at that time properly established his
power; for, when informed of the injury which had
been inflicted on his guest, he only observed that
such accidents were not to be prevented in cities
filled with troops. This point was very soon made
still clearer. In a few days the soldiers burst out
into open rebellion, pillaged the inhabitants, committed
every description of atrocity, and pursued his
highness himself into his castle, where they for some
time held him besieged. When this storm had
blown over, Belzoni, whose hydraulic project was
highly approved of by the pasha, commenced the
construction of his machine in his highness’s gardens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
at Soubra, three miles from Cairo. As Mohammed
Ali is not bigotedly attached to oriental
fashions, he freely permitted Belzoni to be witness
of his amusements, which he was sometimes even
called upon to multiply. During his stay at Soubra
business frequently required his presence at Cairo,
where, on one occasion, he narrowly escaped being
shot by a Turkish soldier. The ruffian having struck
him in the street, he returned the blow; upon which
the Turk drew his pistol, fired at him, singed his
hair, and killed one of his comrades who happened
to be standing behind the traveller. The man was
next day apprehended by the pasha, and never more
heard of. When the hydraulic machine was completed,
its power was made trial of in the presence
of Mohammed, who, perceiving that as an innovation
it was regarded with extraordinary dislike by
the Turkish and Arabic cultivators, abandoned the
project altogether, without even remunerating the
traveller for the loss of time and money which he
had incurred.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these circumstances, which reflect
but little honour on Mohammed Ali, Belzoni
found, upon calculation, that his finances would still
enable him to ascend the Nile as far as Assouan;
and was about to proceed up the country when
Burckhardt and Mr. Salt, who had previously discussed
the point together, determined upon the removal
of the colossal head of young Memnon to
England, for the purpose of being presented to the
British Museum; and requested our traveller, as one
of the fittest persons that could be thought of, to
undertake the task. The expenses Burckhardt and
Mr. Salt were to defray between them. A report
was, it seems, circulated even during the lifetime of
Belzoni, and previous to the publication of his travels,
that in this affair he was merely the paid agent
of Mr. Salt (for, as a professed Mohammedan, Burckhardt
did not choose to appear). This, however, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
clearly not the case. The expenses incurred in the
undertaking they could do no other than defray. Mr.
Salt’s instructions are written, as Belzoni himself
observes, in an assuming style, but nevertheless have
not the air of being addressed to a paid agent. But
the testimony of Sheïkh Burckhardt, which I insert
in justice to the memory of an enterprising and worthy
man, completely sets the matter at rest. In a
letter addressed to the African Association, dated
Cairo, February 20th, 1817, he says, “You will be
pleased to hear that the colossal head from Thebes
has at last, after many difficulties, safely arrived at
Alexandria. Mr. Belzoni, who offered himself to undertake
this commission, has executed it with great
spirit, intelligence, and perseverance. The head is
waiting now at Alexandria for a proper conveyance
to Malta. Mr. Salt and myself have borne the expenses
jointly; and the trouble of the undertaking
has devolved upon Mr. Belzoni, whose name I wish
to be mentioned, if ever ours shall, on this occasion,
because he was actuated by public spirit fully as
much as ourselves.”</p>

<p>Few things are more interesting in themselves, or
less captivating in description, than a search after
antiquities. Belzoni, after visiting Hermontis and
Dendara, arrived at Thebes, which, from the time
of Germanicus to the present moment, has excited
the wonder and admiration of every traveller who
has beheld it. “It is absolutely impossible,” says
Belzoni, “to imagine the scene displayed, without
seeing it. The most sublime ideas that can be
formed from the most magnificent specimens of our
present architecture would give a very incorrect picture
of these ruins; for such is the difference, not
only in magnitude, but in form, proportion, and construction,
that even the pencil can convey but a faint
idea of the whole. It appeared to me like entering
a city of giants, who, after a long conflict, were all
destroyed, leaving the ruins of their various temples
as the only proof of their existence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>After a brief examination of these mighty ruins,
he crossed to the western bank of the Nile, where,
amid the vast remains of the Memnonium, was the
colossal head which he was to remove. He found
it, he says, near the remains of its body and chair,
with its face upwards, and apparently smiling on him
at the thought of being taken to England. The implements
which he had brought from Cairo were
sufficiently simple: fourteen poles, eight of which
were employed in making a sort of car to lay the
bust on, four ropes of palm-leaves, and four rollers,
without tackle of any sort. Their boat lying too far
to be used as a lodging every night, they established
themselves in the Memnonium, where, as the traveller
remarks, they were handsomely lodged in a
small hut formed of stones. Mrs. Belzoni seems, in
fact, to have been as enterprising and romantic as
her husband, and made no difficulty about the rudeness
of their accommodation. Into a detail of his
laborious exertions, or those of the Arabs in conveying
the head to the Nile, I do not think it necessary
to enter. It will be sufficient to state, that
after incredible toil and perseverance, it was at
length brought to the edge of the stream on the 12th
of August, 1816.</p>

<p>This object being effected, he made an excursion
to the sepulchral excavations in the mountain of
Gornou, celebrated for the quantity of mummies
which they contain. Into this vast labyrinth he entered
with two Arabs and his interpreter. They
were in search of a sarcophagus which was said to
have been discovered by Drovetti; but, in roaming
about amid the dreary passages, lost their way,
which, without extraordinary good fortune, might
have been the first step to losing their lives. In
labouring to find a passage out, they came to a
small aperture, through which the interpreter and
one of the Arabs passed easily, but Belzoni, who was
a very large man, found it too small. “One of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
Arabs, however, succeeded, as did my interpreter;
and it was then agreed,” says he, “that I and the
other Arab should wait till their return. They proceeded
evidently to a great distance, for the light
disappeared, and only a murmuring sound from their
voices could be distinguished as they went on. After
a few moments I heard a loud noise, and the interpreter
distinctly crying, ‘O mon Dieu! O mon Dieu!
je suis perdu!’ after which a profound silence ensued.
I asked my Arab whether he had ever been in that
place. He replied, ‘Never.’ I could not conceive
what could have happened, and thought the best plan
was to return to procure help from the other Arabs.
Accordingly, I told my man to show me the way out
again; but, staring at me like an idiot, he said he did
not know the road. I called repeatedly to the interpreter,
but received no answer. I watched a long
time, but no one returned, and my situation was no
very pleasant one.”</p>

<p>At length, however, by dint of laborious perseverance,
they issued into upper air; and as the sarcophagus,
which they had discovered, could not at that
moment be removed, our traveller conceived the design
of making a small excursion into Nubia. Accordingly,
he proceeded up the river to Assouan,
where, after much altercation, he procured a fresh
boat to carry him to the second cataract. He admired,
in passing, the beautiful island of Phile, rich
in the ruins of antiquity. On the next day several
natives, armed with spears and shields of crocodile
skins, came in boats to attack them on the river;
but observing them, Mrs. Belzoni and all, to be
armed with pistols, they very prudently retired. At
Deir, the capital of Lower Nubia, our traveller purchased
with a small looking-glass permission to continue
his voyage. Previous to this, many of the
people of the country had never enjoyed the gratification
of contemplating the reflection of their own
countenances, unless, like Polypheme, they made a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
mirror of the glassy stream. On arriving at Ipsambul,
he saw with amazement the great rock-temple
discovered by Burckhardt. He immediately conceived
the design of clearing away the sand which
obstructed the entrance into the temple, and made
the proposal to the villagers, promising, in order to
excite them to the task, a present in money; but
soon found that he had at length arrived in a region
where money had ceased to be omnipotent. The
people stared at his piasters as they would have
stared at a letter in an unknown language, and inquired
who would give them any thing for such small
bits of metal as those? However, he by degrees
succeeded in convincing them that money possessed
over civilized men, and all who came within their
influence, a mysterious power which they could not
resist, and thus awakened in their souls the “accursed
thirst of gold.” This seemed at first to produce
a good effect; but the love of money once excited,
they knew not where to stop; and their avarice,
which he had reckoned his best ally, soon
exhausted his means, so that before he had half-completed
his undertaking he was compelled to
desist, and continue his voyage up the Nile to Ibrim
and the first cataract.</p>

<p>Having gratified his curiosity with a glance at
these celebrated spots, Belzoni returned to Assouan,
and from thence proceeded to Thebes, where he immediately
put in train the measures necessary for
conveying down the river the Memnon’s head, and
various other antiquities. The obstacles which
were thrown in his way by the obstinacy of the natives,
and the intrigues of Drovetti, and other collectors
of antiquities, were numerous, and highly
disgraceful to their originators. Nevertheless, on
the 17th of November, 1816, he succeeded in placing
the head on board of a boat, in which he set sail on
the 21st for Cairo, where he arrived on the 15th of
December, after a voyage of twenty-four days. All
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
professions reckon among their members many
knaves and many fools; but the antiquarians with
whom Belzoni came in contact deserved, in several
instances, to be sent to the galleys. His labours
were, as a matter of course, depreciated by several
foreigners of this cast, who absurdly misrepresented
his researches. In this number must be reckoned
Count Forbin, who was frightened away from Thebes
by beholding the apparition of an English waiting-maid
in a blue pelisse among the ruins. This gentleman,
in his absurd “Travels,” represents our
traveller as having employed six months in placing
the colossal bust on board the boat, although he
knew, or should have known, that the operation did
not occupy a sixth part of that time. The origin of
this contemptible fiction was the jealousy which the
idea of seeing this extraordinary piece of antiquity
in the possession of the English inspired. An able
writer in the Quarterly Review, after animadverting
in a very spirited manner upon the meanness of these
proceedings, observes, “But detraction, it would appear,
is not all that Mr. Belzoni has had to sustain
from this irrational jealousy. M. Drovetti, French
consul, has, as Count Forbin observes, two agents
at Thebes,&mdash;the one a Mameluke, named Yousuf,
originally a drummer in the French army; the other
a Marseillese renegade of the name of Riffo, ‘small
in stature, bold, enterprising, and choleric; beating
the Arabs because they had neither time nor taste
to understand the Provençal language.’ These persons
are more than suspected of being concerned in
a plot against the life of Mr. Belzoni, who was recently
fired at from behind a wall, while employed
in his researches among the ruins of Carnac, where
these two fellows were then known to be lurking.
The affair has been brought before the Consular
Court at Cairo; and we trust that M. Drovetti, for
the sake of his own character and that of his country,
will not interfere with the judicial proceedings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
nor attempt to shelter his agents from the punishment
which awaits them.”</p>

<p>From Cairo Belzoni proceeded with the bust down
the Nile to Rosetta and Alexandria; from whence,
after having placed his charge in the pasha’s warehouses,
he quickly returned, for the purpose of proceeding
on a second voyage up the Nile. It was on
this occasion that he had the good fortune to become
known to Mr. Briggs, with whom he returned
to Cairo. Captain Caviglia had at this period commenced
his researches in the interior of the first
pyramid of Ghizeh; but was about to discontinue them
for lack of means, when Mr. Briggs munificently engaged
to furnish funds for the purpose, in which he
was seconded by Mr. Salt. It was proposed by this
latter gentleman that Belzoni should join Captain
Caviglia in his researches; but our traveller, with
commendable ambition, preferred some undertaking
in which all the credit should redound to himself;
and, having left his wife at the house of a friend at
Cairo, he once more ascended the Nile, accompanied
by Mr. Beechey, to whom he had been introduced
at Alexandria.</p>

<p>At Eraramoun, near Ashmouneir, Belzoni obtained
intelligence that two agents of M. Drovetti were
hurrying on towards Thebes, in the hope of forestalling
him in the purchase of antiquities; upon
which he hired two asses, and, leaving Mr. Beechey
to come up slowly with the boat, hurried off by night.
On reaching the ruins, after an incredibly fatiguing
journey of five days, he found that, although the
agents were not arrived, Mr. Salt’s neglect, in not
paving the way with a handsome present, had so
completely irritated the bey, that he had appropriated
to the French ex-consul the very ground upon which
Belzoni had commenced his excavations during his
first journey. Into the details of these wretched
squabbles, which it is humiliating to the lovers of
art even to peruse, I shall of course not enter. Belzoni,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
it should be observed, was forced into them
much against his feelings; for he was an educated,
liberal, and high-minded man, altogether averse from
low caballing and intrigue, which appear to have
formed the native element of Drovetti and his congenial
coadjutor, the Count de Forbin.</p>

<p>The most interesting transaction, perhaps, in which
our traveller was anywhere engaged, was his visit
to the Necropolis of Thebes, in the mountain of
Gournou. This is a tract of about two miles in
length, at the foot of the Libyan ridge. Every part
of these rocks is scooped out into a sepulchre, which,
however close it may be to other sepulchral chambers,
has rarely any interior communication with
them. It is impossible, as Belzoni observes, to convey
by description an adequate idea of these subterraneous
abodes and their inhabitants. No other
sepulchres in the world resemble them. There are
no excavations or mines that can be compared with
those astonishing places, which, when once seen,
for ever after haunt the imagination, like a glimpse
of the regions beyond the grave. Few travellers see
more of these catacombs than the exterior chambers,
from which the dead have been removed. In
the interior sepulchres the air is suffocating, and frequently
causes fainting. The dust of decayed mummies,
which is so fine that it quickly penetrates in
vast quantities to the lungs, and causes a difficulty
of respiration; the strong effluvia of decomposed
bodies; the dark, dismal, lonesome nature of the
place;&mdash;every thing tends to discourage the intruder.
Belzoni was not, however, to be deterred. In describing
the difficulties which he here encountered,
he observes, “In some places there is not more than
the vacancy of a foot left, which you must contrive
to pass through in a creeping posture, like a snail,
on pointed and keen stones that cut like glass. After
getting through these passages, some of them two
or three hundred yards long, you generally find a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
more commodious place, perhaps high enough to sit.
But what a place of rest! surrounded by bodies, by
heaps of mummies, in all directions, which, previous
to my being accustomed to the sight, impressed me
with horror. The blackness of the wall; the faint
light given by the candles or torches for want of
air; the different objects that surrounded me seeming
to converse with each other; and the Arabs with
the candles or torches in their hands, naked and
covered with dust, themselves resembling living
mummies,&mdash;absolutely formed a scene that cannot
be described. In such a situation I found myself
several times, and often returned exhausted and fainting,
till at last I became inured to it, and indifferent
to what I suffered except from the dust, which never
failed to choke my throat and nose; and though fortunately
I am destitute of the sense of smelling, I
could taste that the mummies were rather unpleasant
to swallow. After the exertion of entering into
such a place, through a passage of fifty, a hundred,
three hundred, or perhaps six hundred yards, nearly
overcome, I sought a resting-place, found one, and
contrived to sit; but when my weight bore on the
body of an Egyptian, it crushed it like a bandbox. I
naturally had recourse to my hands to sustain my
weight, but they found no better support; so that I
sank altogether among the broken mummies, with a
crash of bones, rags, and wooden cases, which raised
such a dust as kept me motionless for a quarter of
an hour, waiting till it subsided again. I could not
move from the place, however, without increasing
it, and every step I took crushed a mummy in some
part or other. Once I was conducted from such a
place to another resembling it, through a passage of
about twenty feet in length, and no wider than that
the body could be forced through. It was choked
with mummies, and I could not pass without putting
my face in contact with that of some decayed Egyptian;
but as the passage inclined downwards, my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
own weight helped me on. However, I could not
help being covered with bones, legs, arms, and heads,
rolling from above. Thus I proceeded from one
cave to another, all full of mummies, piled up in various
ways, some standing, some lying, and some on
their heads. The purpose of my researches was to
rob the Egyptians of their papyri, of which I found
a few hidden in their breasts, under their arms, and
in the space above the knees, or on the legs, and
covered by the numerous folds of cloth that envelop
the mummy.”</p>

<p>Belzoni continued indefatigably making new researches
both at Gournou and Carnac, but was at
length put to flight by the machinations of the
French, who had succeeded in gaining over to their
party the bey of the province. He then resolved
once more to ascend the Nile to Ipsambul, and was
fortunate enough to meet with two English travellers,
Captains Irby and Mangles, who were desirous
of performing the same voyage. They hired a
boat between them at Philo, where they celebrated
the birth-day of George the Third, and setting out
together in high spirits, visited the second cataract,
and then returned to Ipsambul. Here the wrong-headedness
and quarrelsome disposition of the Nubians
considerably obstructed their labours in clearing
away the entrance to the temple. But at length,
having dismissed the native labourers, and undertaken
the task themselves, they succeeded, and enjoyed
the satisfaction of beholding one of the most
perfect and beautiful rock-temples in the world.</p>

<p>Having completed this laborious operation, our
traveller returned to his old station at Thebes, where
he continued his researches in the valley of Beban
el Malook. Here, among other remarkable antiquities,
he discovered one relic of the ancient
world, which certainly appears to rank among the
most beautiful that have ever been exhumed. “It
is,” says he, “a sarcophagus of the finest oriental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
alabaster, nine feet five inches long, and three feet
seven inches wide. Its thickness is only two inches,
and it is transparent when a light is placed inside it.
It is minutely sculptured within and without with
several hundred figures which do not exceed two
inches in height, and represent, as I suppose, the
whole of the funeral procession and ceremonies
relating to the deceased, united with several emblems,
&amp;c. I cannot give an adequate idea of this
beautiful and invaluable piece of antiquity, and can
only say, that nothing has been brought into Europe
from Egypt that can be compared to it. The cover
was not there; it had been taken out and broken into
several pieces.”</p>

<p>Of the tomb in which this extraordinary monument
was found a model was many years afterward
exhibited in London, and so exceedingly well executed
was the representation, that had it not been
for the crowds of visiters, one might easily have
imagined one’s self in the sepulchres of the Egyptian
kings. Belzoni wanted but one thing to render him
one of the greatest antiquarian collectors in the
world: this one thing was money. But for the
lack of this, many of his most arduous and well-planned
enterprises came to nothing.</p>

<p>From Thebes, with which he was now as familiar
as he was with London, he some time after this
proceeded to Cairo. He had by this time acquired
quite a passion for excavations, tomb-opening, and
all those other pursuits by which travellers aim at
diving into the mysteries of Egyptian manners and
arts; and reflecting upon the success of Captain
Caviglia in descending into the well of the Great
Pyramid, the project of attempting the opening of
the second occurred to him. It were beside my
purpose to describe the difficulties which he encountered
and overcame in the execution of this design.
His labours were incessant; his expenses considerable;
but, at length, after success had frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
appeared hopeless, the entrance to the interior
chambers was found. “After thirty days’ exertion,”
says he, “I had the pleasure of finding myself in
the way to the central chamber of one of the two
great pyramids of Egypt, which have long been the
admiration of beholders!”</p>

<p>This object having been happily effected, Belzoni
again set out for Thebes. There he was made acquainted
with the history of a pretended discovery,
which became a motive for a journey to the coast
of the Red Sea. The history of this expedition is
given in a very few words by a writer in the Quarterly
Review whom I have already cited. “A French
mineralogist, of the name of Caillaud, had accompanied
some Arab soldiers sent by the pasha of
Egypt in search of emeralds among the mountains
between the Nile and the Red Sea. On their return,
this person gave out (as we learn from an intelligent
correspondent in the Malta Gazette) that in this expedition
he had discovered the ancient city of the
Ptolemies, the celebrated Bernicé, the great emporium
of Europe and the Indies, of which he gave a
magnificent description. Mr. Belzoni, doubtful of
the accuracy of the story, set out from Edfoo, with
one of the former party, to visit the supposed
Bernicé; where, instead of the ruins of 800 houses
and three temples, as stated by M. Caillaud, he could
find no more than eighty-seven scattered houses, or
rather cells; the greater number of which did not
exceed <i>ten feet square</i>, built with unhewn stones,
and without cement; and the only appearance of a
temple was a niche in a rock, without inscription or
sculpture of any kind; there was no land for cultivation,
nor any water within twenty-four miles;
no communication with the sea but by a rough road
over the mountains of twenty-four miles; and the
shore was so covered with projecting rocks for
twenty or thirty miles on each side, that there was
no security even for the smallest boats, much less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
for ships trading to India. These, therefore, he was
quite certain, could not be the remains of Bernicé.</p>

<p>As, however, the site of this celebrated city had
been fully described by the ancient writers, Mr. Belzoni
determined to prosecute his researches; and at
the end of twenty days he discovered, close to the
shore, the extensive ruins of an ancient city near
the Cape Lepte Extrema, the Ras el Auf of the
present day; the projection of which forms an
ample bay (now named Foul Bay), having at the
bottom an excellent harbour for vessels of small
burden. These ruins, which are beyond dispute
those of the celebrated emporium founded by Ptolemy
Philadelphus, were four days’ journey from
the rude cells of the quarrymen or miners, which
M. Caillaud is stated to have so strangely mistaken
for the magnificent vestiges of the ancient Bernicé.
Several wells of bitter water were found among the
ruins; and between them and the mountains was an
extensive plain fit for cultivation. The remains of
more than 3000 houses were counted, about the
centre of which were those of a temple with sculptured
figures and hieroglyphics.”</p>

<p>Having made this discovery, he again returned to
the valley of the Nile, where he was for some time
occupied in the removal of various antiquities. He
then descended to the seacoast, and on the 20th of
April, 1819, set out from Rosetta, on an excursion
to the district of Fayoum, and the Oasis of Jupiter
Ammon. After roaming about the shores of Lake
Mœris for some time, for he had no leisure for
making researches, he visited the ruins of Arconde,
consisting of a few granite columns and fragments
and mounds of burnt bricks. He then prepared to
cross the desert to the Oasis, which was an affair of
some difficulty. Nevertheless, he at length succeeded
in completing his preparations, and commenced
his journey, accompanied by a Bedouin
guide, and three or four other persons. Even here,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
in the desert, ruins of Egyptian edifices, beautifully
sculptured with hieroglyphics, were found. The
scene at first lay among low rocks, sandy hills, and
barren valleys, which were gradually exchanged for
a plain of sand, as level as the sea, and thickly
strewed with brown and black pebbles. They continued
during five days their journey over this dreary
waste, at the end of which time they perceived the
rocks of the Oasis, and beheld two crows coming, as
it were, to meet them. In the afternoon they entered
the valley, which is surrounded by high rocks,
and forms in the midst a spacious plain, about twelve
or fourteen miles long, and about six in breadth.
“There is only a very small portion of the valley
cultivated on the opposite side to that which we
reached, and it can only be distinguished by the
woods of palm-trees which cover it. The rest of
the valley is wholly covered with tracts of sand, but
it is evidently seen it has once been cultivated everywhere.
Many tracts of land are of a clayey substance,
which could be brought into use even now.
There are several small hills scattered about, some
with a natural spring at the top, and covered with
rushes and small plants. We advanced towards a
forest of date-trees, and before evening we reached
within a mile of a village named Zaboo, all of us
exceedingly thirsty: here we observed some cultivation,
several beds of rice and some sunt-trees, &amp;c.
Before the camels arrived, they scented the water at
a distance; and as they had not drank since they
left Rejan, they set off at full gallop, and did not
stop till they reached a rivulet, which was quite
sweet, although the soil was almost impregnated
with salt. I observed here a great many wild birds,
particularly wild ducks, in greater abundance than
any other.”</p>

<p>The first man who perceived them after their entrance
into the valley evinced a disposition to shoot
Belzoni; but, upon the explanation of the Bedouin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
guide, consented to conduct them to the village.
“We advanced,” says our traveller, “and entered a
lane between these plants; and as we penetrated
farther, we entered a most beautiful place, full of
dates, intermixed with other trees, some in blossom
and others in fruit: these were apricots, figs, almonds,
plums, and some grapes. The apricots were in
greater abundance than the rest, and the figs were
very fine. The soil was covered with verdure of
grass and rice, and the whole formed a most pleasing
recess, particularly after the barren scenes of
the desert.”</p>

<p>His reception at this village was equivocal: there
being several sheïkhs, each of whom made pretensions
to authority. Some were disposed to treat
him kindly, while others, more morose, kept at a
distance; but a few cups of coffee, judiciously distributed,
and followed by a sheep boiled in rice,
reconciled the whole; although they next morning,
when they were again hungry, relapsed into their
former rude manners. Like all other ignorant
people, they supposed that he must necessarily be
in search of treasure, and for some time refused to
conduct him to the ruins of which he was in search;
but upon being assured that whatever treasures might
be discovered should fall to their share, while all he
stipulated for were a few stones, they consented to
accompany him. The ruins, which, with much
probability, he concluded to be those of the temple
of Jupiter Ammon, now served, he found, as a basement
for nearly a whole village, in the vicinity of
which he discovered the famous “Fountain of the
Sun,” which is warm at midnight and cold at noon.
This is a well of sixty feet deep by eight square,
which, overflowing in a considerable rivulet, serves
to irrigate some cultivated lands. All around it is a
grove of palm and other trees. The temperature
of the water, however, continues at all times the
same; all its apparent changes being accounted for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
by the greater or less degree of heat in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>From this excursion Belzoni returned to Egypt,
from whence he embarked for Europe about the
middle of September, 1819. After an absence of
twenty years he returned to his family; whence he
departed for England, where he completed and published
his travels. A few years afterward this enterprising
and able traveller fell in an attempt to penetrate
into the interior of Africa.</p>

<p class="h2sub">Born 1754.&mdash;Died 1825</p>

<p>This traveller was born at Givry, near Chalons-sur-Soane,
in Burgundy. He was descended from
a noble family, and commenced his career in life as
a royal page. When he had for some time served
in the palace in this capacity, he was nominated
gentleman in ordinary to the king; not long after
which he obtained the office of secretary to an embassy.
In this capacity he accompanied the Baron
de Talleyrand, ambassador of France to Naples,
where, during the absence of the ambassador, he
remained <i>chargé des affaires</i>. At the epoch of the
emigration he incurred the displeasure of Queen
Marie Caroline, and in consequence removed to
Venice, where he was known under the name of the
Chevalier Denon, and became one of the most distinguished
members of the society of Madame Albrizzi.
This lady has sketched his portrait in her
<i>Ritratti</i>. After having spoken in a highly laudatory
strain of his passion for knowledge, his intrepidity
in danger, the constant gayety of his mind, the fertility
of his imagination, the versatility of his character,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
his irresistible inclination to drollery, she
adds, “He is generally supposed to resemble Voltaire.
For my own part, I would admit that in his
physiognomy you may discover that of Voltaire,
but in the physiognomy of Voltaire you would look
in vain for that of Denon. That which, in my opinion,
they possess in common, is simply an indication
of sprightliness, vivacity, versatility, and a certain
sarcastic air in the look and smile, which amuses
while it terrifies; but the physiognomy of Voltaire
indicates none of those qualities which characterize
the soul of Denon.”</p>

<p>During his stay in Italy, Denon diligently applied
himself to the art of design, in which, as was afterward
seen, he acquired a remarkable facility and
power. On the breaking out of the revolution he
adopted its principles, and even connected himself
with the most furious jacobins, with the intention,
it has been said, of snatching a few victims from
their fangs. But, notwithstanding all this, he would
probably have sunk into that oblivion which has
already devoured the memory of so many actors in
those sanguinary times, had not the Egyptian expedition
placed him in an advantageous position before
the world. He had all his life, he says, been desirous
of travelling in Egypt, and easily obtained the
consent of Napoleon to accompany him. Embarking
at Marseilles on the 14th of May, 1799, he sailed
along the shores of Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and
Malta, where he landed and made some stay, and
then proceeded to Egypt. Having had the good fortune
to escape the English fleet in a fog, he landed
near Alexandria with the French troops, of whose
movements I shall take no further notice, except in
as far as they may be connected with the actions
of Denon.</p>

<p>It has been truly remarked by Volney, that on arriving
any foreign country, how many descriptions
soever you may have read of it, you nevertheless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
find every thing new and strange; as if, in fact,
you had just discovered it. Denon was precisely in
this predicament. He had, no doubt, read what had
been written respecting Egypt; yet he looked upon
it as a country of which little beyond the name was
known in Europe, and consequently commenced the
study of its antiquities with all possible enthusiasm.
His views, though vanity had some influence in the
formation of them, were tolerably correct. Egypt
has indeed been often visited, and in many instances
by able men and accomplished scholars; but no one
who has toiled, as I have, through the descriptions
of these various travellers, can avoid making the
discovery that very much remains yet to be done
before we can be said to possess a thorough knowledge
of Egypt, ancient or modern.</p>

<p>From Alexandria Denon proceeded with Kleber’s
division towards Rosetta; clouds of Arabs
hung on their front and in their rear, cutting off
every man who lagged behind, or strayed to the
distance of fifty yards from the main body. Desaix
himself narrowly escaped; and several young officers,
less on the alert, were either made prisoners
or shot. After making numerous little excursions
in the Delta, he set out for Upper Egypt, which, in
his opinion, had never before been visited by a
European; so that, if we interpret him literally, all
the travellers who had previously described that
country were so many fiction-mongers. In ascending
the Nile, he beheld at ten leagues’ distance from
Cairo the points of the Pyramids piercing the horizon.
These prodigious monuments, which, even
more powerfully than Thebes itself, command the
attention of every traveller in Egypt, he soon visited
with an escort, and sketched from various positions.
The city of Cairo disappointed his expectations,
which appear to have been absurd, since he had
formed his ideas of the place from the “Arabian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
Nights,” rather than from the descriptions of
travellers.</p>

<p>The population of Cairo, which, though far less
numerous than is commonly supposed, is still very
great, saw with disgust and horror the triumph of the
Franks; who, they feared, might soon introduce
among them the eating of the “unclean beast,” abhorred
by Jews and Mussulmans, with drinking,
gambling, and other accomplishments which Mohammed
had prohibited to his followers. They
therefore determined to shake off the yoke which
they had too tamely suffered to be placed on their
necks. Rushing fiercely to arms, they attacked their
invaders with fury. The house which had been appropriated
to the learned men who accompanied the
expedition stood apart from the city, and was surrounded
by gardens. Here they were collected
together when the revolt began. The report of
musketry and symptoms of increasing consternation
soon informed them, however, of what was going
forward in the more populous quarters, and their
alarm was proportioned to the solitude by which
they were surrounded. Presently a report reached
them that the house of General Caffarelli had been
sacked and pillaged, and that several members of
the commission of arts had perished. They now
reviewed their numbers, and four of the party were
missing. In an hour after this it was ascertained
that they had been massacred. Meanwhile no one
could give any account of Napoleon; night was
coming on; the firing continued; shouts and clamours
filled the air; and it was evident that the insurrection
was general. A tremendous carnage had already
taken place, but the inhabitants still held out, having
in one half of the city adopted that barricading system
in which they were recently imitated by the
people of Paris; and in others, taken refuge, to the
number of four thousand, in a spacious mosque,
from whence they repulsed two companies of grenadiers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
Night produced a pause in the struggle. At
the commencement of the insurrection the literati
had been granted a guard, but about midnight the
exigences of the moment caused this to be withdrawn;
when they themselves took arms, and,
though every man was disposed to command and
none to obey, prepared to receive the insurgents.
Thus the night passed away in confusion and slaughter,
and in the morning the French were again masters
of the city.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged, to the honour of the
French, that, whatever their conduct in Egypt may
have been in other respects, nothing could be more
constant than their ardour for the sciences. In the
midst of battles, revolts, and dangers of every kind,
their researches were still continued. We accordingly
find Denon, just escaped from becoming a
mummy himself, busily engaged in dissecting an
ibis, five hundred mummies of which bird had just
been discovered in the caverns of Saccara. He next
witnessed an exhibition of the achievements of the
Psylli; but his incredulity and self-sufficiency disinclined
him from making any serious inquiries on the
subject of their power over serpents, which he was
contented with turning into ridicule: an unfortunate
propensity for a traveller, who should abandon all
such absurd displays of littleness to the wits of the
metropolis.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Denon accompanied General
Desaix on an expedition into Upper Egypt. The
Mamelukes, though forced to retire, still continued
to make head against their enemies, who, if they triumphed
over them through the effects of discipline,
were assuredly neither more brave nor more enterprising.
When they drew near the place where the
Mamelukes under Murad Bey were reported to be
encamped, Desaix was informed that Murad was
already putting himself in motion to attack him.
The French general, no less chivalrous than Murad,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
determined at once to anticipate the attack. Both
armies came in sight of each other in the evening.
It was too late for battle. The victory which both
parties promised themselves was deferred until the
morrow. In the Mameluke camp the night was
spent in rejoicings; and their sentinels approached,
with laughter and insult, the advanced posts of the
French. The battle commenced with the dawn.
Murad, at the head of his redoubtable Mamelukes
and eight or ten thousand Arabs, appeared ready for
the attack. The French formed with rapidity, and
the combat commenced. Never, on any occasion,
was more impetuous bravery displayed than by
Murad and his Mamelukes on this day. Finding
that the chances of battle were turning against
them, their habitual courage degenerated into fury:
they galloped up, reckless of danger, to the ranks of
their enemies, and endeavoured to open themselves
a way through the bayonets and muskets of the
French, which they attempted to hew in pieces with
their sabres. Failing in this, they made their horses
rear and plunge into the opposing lines, or backed
them against the bayonets, in the hope of breaking
and dispersing them. When this desperate measure
also deceived their hopes, they lost all government
of their rage, and in the madness of their despair,
threw their muskets, pistols, and blunderbusses at
the enemy; or, if dismounted, crept along the ground,
beneath the bayonets, to cut at the legs of the soldiers.
It was in this fight that an instance of ferocity
on both sides, unsurpassed by any thing of
the kind recorded in history, occurred: a French
soldier and a Mameluke, engaged in mortal struggle
on the ground, were discovered by an officer, just as
the Frenchman was cutting the throat of his enemy.
“How can you be guilty of so horrible an action,”
said the officer, “in the state in which you are?”
The soldier replied, “You talk very finely, at your
ease, sir; for my own part, however, I have but a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
moment to live, and I mean to enjoy it!” The
Mamelukes retired, but they did not fly; and it cost
the French torrents of blood before the victory was
completed.</p>

<p>This victory caused Desaix to return once more
to Cairo for a reinforcement, after which the journey
towards the south was resumed. At Miniel Guidi,
while Denon was sitting beside the general in the
shade, a criminal, who had been caught in stealing
the muskets from the volunteers, was brought up
for judgment. It was a boy not more than twelve
years of age, beautiful as an angel, but bleeding from
a large sabre wound which he had received in his
arm. He paid no attention to his wound, but presented
himself with an ingenuous and confident air
before the general, whom he soon discovered to be
his judge. How great is the power of unaffected
grace! The anger of every person present immediately
disappeared. He was first questioned respecting
the person who had instigated the crime.
“No one,” he replied. The question was repeated
under another form: he answered that “he did not
know&mdash;the powerful&mdash;the Almighty.”&mdash;“Have you
any relations?”&mdash;“Only a mother, very poor, and
blind.” He was then informed, that if he confessed
who had sent him nothing would be done to him;
whereas certain punishment would ensue upon his
concealing the truth. “I have told you,” he said,
“I was sent by no one; God alone inspired me!”
Then placing his cap at the feet of the general, he
continued, “Behold my head, command it to be
struck off.”&mdash;“Poor fellow!” exclaimed Desaix, “let
him be dismissed.” He was led away, and divining
his fate from the looks of the general, he departed
with a smile.</p>

<p>Here they enjoyed the unusual pleasure of a
shower of rain. On visiting the ruins of Oxyrinchus,
Denon suffered one of the penalties attached to a
hopeless creed; beholding around him nothing but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
desolation and sterility, a thousand melancholy
ideas glided into his mind; he saw the desert encroaching
upon the cultivated soil, as the domain of
death encroaches upon life; the tombs in the pathless
waste seemed the emblems of death and annihilation.
The gayety described by Signora Albrizzi
had now fled. He thought himself alone, and felt all
that awful solitude inspired by a want of faith in the
spiritual nature of man, that faith which sheds around
us, wherever we move, a light by which we discern the
links that unite us to our Creator, and to every thing
noble and immortal in the works of his hands. He
was not, however, alone. Desaix had wandered to
the same spot, and having apparently yielded, like
himself, to the fatal error of the times, experienced
the same sensations, and was oppressed by the same
gloom.</p>

<p>They shortly afterward set out together, escorted
by three hundred men, on an excursion to the ruins
of Hermopolis; which, being the first monument of
ancient Egyptian architecture that he beheld, the
Pyramids excepted, became in his mind the type of
that sublime style. Notwithstanding the number
of his escort, Denon soon found that, although arms
might indeed open him a way to places which had
hitherto been inaccessible to travellers, other circumstances,
over which neither himself nor Desaix
could exercise any control, prevented him from maturely
studying what he beheld. A few hours satisfied
the curiosity of the general, and overwhelmed
the soldiers, who felt no curiosity about the matter,
with fatigue. It was therefore necessary to be contented
with a few fugitive glances, as it were, with
a few sketches hastily made, and the hope of returning
again under more favourable auspices.</p>

<p>On approaching Tentyris Denon ventured, he says,
to propose that the army should halt there. Desaix,
though no less sensible than himself of the charms
of these antique ruins, had his mind filled with other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
cares, and met the proposal with anger. Passion,
however, could possess but a momentary influence
over that beautiful mind; shortly afterward he
sought out the enthusiastic traveller, in whose
company he visited Denderah, and admired the sublimity
of its ponderous architecture. In the evening,
Latournerie, a young officer remarkable for his
courage and the delicacy of his taste, observed to
Denon, “Ever since I have arrived in Egypt, continual
disappointment has made me ill and melancholy.
The sight of Denderah has revived me.
What I have seen this day has repaid me for all my
fatigues; and whatever may be the fate to which
the present expedition shall lead me, the remembrance
of this day will cause me to rejoice, as long
as I live, that I was engaged in it.”</p>

<p>Two days after this, on turning the point of a chain
of mountains, the army came in sight of the ruins of
Thebes. Denon loved above all things to be original.
In approaching the wreck of this mighty city,
Homer’s phrase, “Thebes with its hundred gates,”
occurred to him; he repeated it, and then descanted
upon its poetical vanity, and the folly of those who
harped upon this string. As soon as the army came
in sight of these gigantic ruins, the whole body
stopped spontaneously as one man, and clapped their
hands with admiration and delight. The conquest
of Egypt appeared to be complete. Our traveller,
who rivalled Dr. Syntax himself in his love of the
picturesque, immediately set about sketching the
view, as if it had been merely a city of vapour, like
that which appears under the name of the “Palace
of the Rajah Harchund,” in the desert of Ajmere.
Being desirous of beholding at once all the wonders
of this stupendous city, he quickly visited those
colossal statues which are found in a sitting posture
in the neighbouring plain, which he supposed to be
those of the mother and son of Ossymandyas.</p>

<p>From Thebes he proceeded with General Belliard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
to Syene, while Desaix struck off into the desert in
search of a detachment of Mamelukes. Here he resided
for some time, making the island of Elephantina
his country-house, and Syene his head-quarters.
He visited the cataracts, the island of Phile, and
made drawings of whatever was striking or remarkable
in the vicinity. After a considerable stay, he
returned towards the north, where he bade adieu to
his friend Desaix, never to meet again. He afterward
made a second excursion to Thebes, Denderah,
and other celebrated spots; and experienced, during
one of these rambles, the effects of the Khamsyn
wind, variously described by travellers, according to
the variety of their temperaments. It was about
the middle of May, the heat was almost intolerable,
a complete stagnation seemed to have taken place in
the air. “At the very moment,” he says, “when to
remove the painful sensation occasioned by such a
state of the atmosphere, I was hastening to bathe in
the Nile, all nature seemed to have put on a new
aspect: the light and colours were such as I had
never seen before; the sun, without being concealed,
had lost its rays; become dimmer than the moon, it
yielded but a pale light, diffused around every object
without shadows; the water no longer reflected its
rays, and appeared troubled: the aspect of every
thing was changed; it was the earth which now appeared
luminous, while the air was dim, and seemed
opaque; the trees, beheld through a yellow horizon,
wore a dirty blue colour; a long column of birds
swept before the cloud; the terrified animals wandered
wild through the plain, and the peasants, who
pursued them with shouts, failed to collect them
together. The wind, which had raised this prodigious
mass of sand, and transported it along
through the atmosphere, had not yet reached us, and
we hoped, by entering into the water, to escape from
its effects. But we had scarcely stepped into the
river before its waves were lifted up by the hurricane,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
dashed over our heads, and carried in an instantaneous
inundation over the plain. The bed of
the Nile seemed shaken under our feet, and its banks
with our garments appeared to have been blown
away. We hurried out of the water, the dust fell
upon us like rain, we were immediately covered as
with a crust. Too much terrified even to put on our
garments, we crept along through a reddish, insufficient
light, partly guiding our steps by the walls,
until at length we found refuge in our lodgings.”</p>

<p>Denon, who really possessed all the genuine enthusiasm
of a traveller, shortly after this undertook
a journey to Cosseir on the Red Sea, where he enjoyed
an opportunity of beholding the manners of the
Arabs under less disadvantages than in the valley of
the Nile. He then returned again to Thebes, where
he visited the sepulchres of Gournon, and descending
the Nile to the seacoast, embarked with Napoleon
on board a frigate, and sailed for France. The
ship, fearful of encountering the English, coasted
along the shores of Africa, as far as the Gulf of Carthage
and Biserta; then, after passing close to Sardinia,
and touching at Corsica, arrived safe on the
coast of Provence.</p>

<p>On his return to France, Napoleon, of whom he
was a devoted admirer, and in whose praise he was
frequently guilty of adulation, conferred upon him
the office of superintendent of museums and the
striking of medals. The triumphal column in the
Place Vendôme was erected under his direction. On
the fall of Napoleon, the king, who was not ignorant
of the merits of Denon, continued him in his offices;
but as on the reappearance of Napoleon in 1815 he
returned to his allegiance to his first sovereign, he
naturally sank with him upon his final fall. In his
place of superintendent of the medal mint he was
succeeded by M. de Puymaurin and by the Comte de
Farbin, as director-general of museums. Denon
enjoyed the reputation, however, of being the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
competent person in Paris for filling the offices of
which he had been deprived. Remarking upon those
changes, “It would be difficult,” says the Quarterly
Review, “to discover on what grounds an old and
meritorious servant, who, like Denon, had distinguished
himself by his knowledge of antiquities, by
his taste and execution in the fine arts, and by his zeal
for their promotion among his countrymen, was dismissed
to make room for the present Apollo of the
Museum, who has not the good fortune to be gifted
with science, art, or taste, or even with the semblance
of zeal or respect for any of them.” Denon
died in 1827, leaving behind him an extensive and
well-merited reputation, which is likely long to survive.
His travels have been translated into English,
and are still highly esteemed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="REGINALD_HEBER">REGINALD HEBER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">Born 1783.&mdash;Died 1826.</p>

<p>Reginald Heber, equally distinguished for his
talents and for his piety, was born on the 21st of
April, 1783, at Malpas, in the county of Chester.
From his earliest years religion was the predominant
feeling of his mind. His passions, which would
seem to have been naturally ardent, he quickly
learned to hold in subjection; and was thus happily
delivered from those stormy agitations and poignant
regrets to which those who are formed of more fiery
materials are but too frequently liable. Like most
other men who have been remarkable for their attainments
in after-life, Heber was strongly addicted,
while a boy, to extensive miscellaneous reading. Guicciardini
and Machiavelli were among his early favourites.
He admired the great Florentine historian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
for his style, and with a freedom from prejudice which
indicated the purity of his mind, ventured to make
the discovery, that this much-calumniated advocate
of freedom was a far better man than the world was
inclined to admit. At the same time his study of
the sacred Scriptures was incessant. Even while a
child, the principal events which they record were
so firmly imprinted on his memory, that his friends
used to apply to him, when at a loss where to find
the account of any important transaction, or any remarkable
passage.</p>

<p>In the year 1800 Heber was entered a student of
Brazen Nose College, Oxford, where he exhibited
on all occasions the same high sense of religion and
primitive piety which had distinguished him in his
earlier years. His studies in the mean while were
pursued with a passionate ardour, particularly all
those which were connected with poetry, for the
mind of Heber was eminently imaginative; and although
circumstances, which I know not whether
to denominate fortunate or unfortunate (since in
either case he would, like the divine Founder of his
religion, have been employed in doing good), prevented
him from devoting himself to the study and
building of the “lofty rhyme,” his soul was yet a
fountain, as it were, of poetry, which, if possible,
cast additional beauty and splendour on his faith.
However, as I am not, on the present occasion, engaged
in viewing Heber as a poet, or as a divine, it
will not be necessary for me to enter minutely into
a description of his poetical or theological studies.
His “Palestine,” the principal contribution which
he has made to our rich poetical literature, was a
juvenile performance, written before or soon after
he had completed his twentieth year; but the effect
which it produced on those who heard it recited in
the theatre of the college was more extraordinary,
perhaps, than the bare reading of the poem would
lead one to conceive; though the judgment of those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
who then heard it has since been confirmed by the
public. “None,” says an able writer in Blackwood’s
Magazine, who heard Reginald Heber recite his
‘Palestine’ in that magnificent theatre, “will ever
forget his appearance&mdash;so interesting and impressive.
It was known that his old father was somewhere sitting
among the crowded audience, when his universally
admired son ascended the rostrum; and we
have heard that the sudden thunder of applause
which then arose so shook his frame, weak and
wasted by long illness, that he never recovered it,
and may be said to have died of the joy dearest to a
parent’s heart. Reginald Heber’s recitation, like
that of all poets whom we have heard recite, was
altogether untrammelled by the critical laws of elocution,
which were not set at defiance, but either by
the poet unknown or forgotten; and there was a
charm in his somewhat melancholy voice, that occasionally
faltered, less from a feeling of the solemnity
and even grandeur of the scene, of which he was
himself the conspicuous object&mdash;though that feeling
did suffuse his pale, ingenuous, and animated
countenance&mdash;than from the deeply-felt sanctity of
his subject, comprehending the most awful mysteries
of God’s revelations to man. As his voice grew
bolder and more sonorous in the hush, the audience
felt that this was not the mere display of the skill
and ingenuity of a clever youth, the accidental triumph
of an accomplished versifier over his compeers,
in the dexterity of scholarship, which is all
that can generally be truly said of such exhibitions;
but that here was a poet indeed, not only of bright
promise, but of high achievement; one whose name
was already written in the roll of the immortals.
And that feeling, whatever might have been the share
of the boundless enthusiasm with which the poem
was listened to, attributable to the influence of the
‘genius loci,’ has been since sanctioned by the judgment
of the world, that has placed ‘Palestine’ at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
very head of the poetry on divine subjects of this
age. It is now incorporated for ever with the poetry
of England.”</p>

<p>In this eloquent tribute to the memory of Heber
there appears to be but one error; it is that which
attributes the death of Reginald’s father to the influence
of excessive joy on a frame debilitated by illness;
a report which we are assured by the widow
of our traveller was wholly without foundation.
During the same year, Napoleon conceived the insane
design of invading England; and thus roused
in the ardent breasts of our countrymen a fierce
spirit of resistance, which affected even the peaceful
college student, who, to use the familiar expression
of Heber in describing himself thus engaged,
“fagged and drilled by turns.” Neither Napoleon
nor his army, however, had been doomed by Providence
to lay their bones in English clay, as, had the
invasion taken place, they must have done; and our
traveller’s military enthusiasm was quickly suffered
to cool.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1804, Heber sustained one of the
heaviest calamities which men can experience on
this side of the grave&mdash;the loss of a father; which
he bore with that deep but meek sorrow which a
youth full of religious hope and untiring resignation
to the will of Providence might be naturally expected
to feel. In the autumn of the same year he was
elected a fellow of All Souls; shortly after which
his academical career terminated, and he exchanged
the mimic world of the university for that far more
arduous scene where many an academical star has
grown dim, though Heber, with the happy fortune
which usually attends the virtuous, continued even
in the great theatre of the world to command the
approval and admiration of mankind.</p>

<p>About the middle of the year 1805, he accompanied
his early friend, Mr. John Thornton, whose
virtues would appear to have been akin to his own,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
on a tour through the north of Europe. They proceeded
by sea to Gottenburg in Sweden, where they
experienced the effect of that strangeness and novelty,
which is felt once by all persons who travel in
a foreign country, but which can never, by any possibility,
visit the mind a second time. Here they
purchased a carriage, and proceeded through the
wildest and most sublime scenery, interspersed with
meadows and corn-fields, on a tour among the mountains
of Norway. At intervals, dispersed over craggy,
desolate heaths, immense numbers of cairns and
Runic columns were discovered,&mdash;which, with pine
forests of sombre hue, large bays of the sea nearly
land-locked, and appearing like so many lakes; cascades,
rocks, cloud-capped mountains,&mdash;produced a
series of impressions upon the mind, characterized
by so high a degree of solemn grandeur, that even
the vast solitudes of the Brenner Alps or Wetterhorn
could scarcely inspire a deeper sense of sublimity.
Amid those wild landscapes the natives
amused themselves with wolf-hunting on sledges,
during the winter; but their ferocious game sometimes
come out in such multitudes from the woods,
that even the most skilled huntsmen were in danger.</p>

<p>At Munkholm, or Monk’s Island, called the Bastille
du Nord, Heber saw, among other prisoners, a
very old man, who had been confined there for
above fifty years, and had lost in a great measure the
use of his faculties; they were much moved by his
appearance, and the answers which he gave. On
being asked how old he was, he answered three hundred
years. His crime was variously reported:
some said he was sent there by his relations for violent
behaviour to his father; others as being a spend-thrift;
and M. Leganger said, as being mad. A
pretty government this, where a man is shut up for
his whole life, and three or four different reasons
given for his imprisonment, all equally uncertain! In
Norway, as well as in some parts of Hadramaut and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
the Coromandel coast, the cattle are fed upon the
refuse of fish, which fattens them rapidly, but seems,
at the same time, totally to change their nature, and
render them unmanageably ferocious.</p>

<p>Heber’s stay in Norway was short. He had the
talent to describe whatever was presented to his
view, but his mild and gentle nature inspired him
with no sympathy for the craggy, barren, desolate
scenery of the Norwegian mountains; and he appears
to have hastened his return to the abodes of
civilization from an instinctive perception of this
fact. Upon passing from Norway into Sweden, they
spent some time at Upsala and the capital; from
whence they crossed the Gulf of Bothnia in a fishing-boat,
to Abo, in Finland. From hence, however,
as it seems to have contained nothing worth
seeing, they proceeded with all possible celerity, the
approved English mode of travelling, to Petersburg.
Notwithstanding the rapidity of their movements,
they found time to make one discovery, which, as it
is the echo of what most travellers repeat of the
countries they visit, I insert for the honour of the
Finns and Russians: “In one point,” says he, “both
the Finlanders and Russians are unfortunately
agreed, I mean in the proverbial knavery of the
lower classes. In Sweden every thing was secure
from theft, and our carriage, with its harness,
cushions, &amp;c., stood every night untouched in the
open street. But we soon found how very inferior
the Sclavonian race is to the Gothic in honesty, and
were obliged to keep a constant watch. I cannot
account for this apparently generic difference. If the
Russians only had been thieves I should have called
it the effects of the slavery of the peasants, but
Swedish Finland is just as bad, and the peasants are
as free as in England.”</p>

<p>Our travellers remained at St. Petersburg until the
30th of December, amusing themselves with learning
the German language, and in seeing sights, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
then departed for Moscow, travelling at the same
prodigious rate as when they fled thither from Abo.
“Our mode of travelling,” says Heber, “deserves
describing, both as very comfortable in itself, and
as being entirely different from every thing in England.
We performed the journey in kabitkas, the
carriages usually employed by the Russians in their
winter journeys: they are nothing more than a very
large cradle, well covered with leather, and placed
on a sledge, with a leather curtain in front; the luggage
is placed at the bottom, the portmanteaus serving
for an occasional seat, and the whole covered
with a mattress, on which one or more persons can
lie at full length, or sit supported by pillows. In
this attitude, and well wrapped up in furs, one can
scarcely conceive a more luxurious mode of getting
over a country, when the roads are good, and the
weather not intense; but in twenty-four or twenty-five
degrees of frost (Reaumur), no wrapping can
keep you quite warm; and in bad roads, of which
we have had some little experience, the jolting is
only equalled by the motion of a ship in a storm.”</p>

<p>From Moscow, where they arrived on the 3d of
January, 1806, they shortly afterward made an excursion
eastward to Yaroslav, on the banks of the
Volga, during which Heber made the remarkable
discovery that the Russian clergy almost universally
were inimical to the government; being more
connected than most other classes of men with the
peasants, many of whose sufferings and oppressions
they shared. They witnessed at Yaroslav a wolf-hunt
on the frozen Volga. It should rather, however,
be termed a “wolf-baiting;” for the animals,
which had been previously caught for the purpose,
were at once set upon by a number of dogs, and
beaten almost blind by the long whips of savages,
whom I cannot term hunters. A couple of hares
were likewise chased upon the ice by Siberian greyhounds,
very beautiful creatures, with silky hair and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
a fan tail, which, though less swift, were said to be
more hardy than our greyhounds.</p>

<p>Heber, somewhat dazzled, as was natural, by the
gorgeous taste of the Muscovites, seems to have
been highly gratified by the reception which he and
his fellow-traveller experienced at the ancient capital
of the empire: “The eastern retinues and luxuries,”
says he, “which one meets with here are almost
beyond belief. There are few English countesses
have so many pearls in their possession as I have
seen in the streets in the cap of a merchant’s
wife. At a ball in the ancient costume, which was
given by M. Nedilensky (secretary of state to the
late empress, whose family we have found the most
agreeable in Moscow), the ladies all wore caps entirely
of pearls, and the blaze of diamonds on their
<i>saraphaus</i> (the ancient Russian tunic) would have
outshone, I think, St. James’s. The pearl bonnet is
not a becoming dress, as it makes its wearer look
very pale, a fault which some ladies had evidently
been endeavouring to obviate.” The heads which
were thus gaudily garnished on the outside were
generally exceedingly empty, as may safely be inferred
from the degree of information possessed by
their fathers, husbands, and brothers; so that the
comparison with English ladies, in whom beauty and
intelligence usually go hand in hand, could, I imagine,
be carried no further.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Moscow about the middle of March,
our traveller proceeded southward through the
Ukraine, the country of the Cossacks, at Charkof,
the capital of which, a university had recently been
established. The professors of this establishment,
who were all very handsomely paid, presented a
motley assemblage of Russians, Germans, and
Frenchmen, nearly every individual of which was
big with some new scheme of teaching or college
government; but this ludicrous appearance would
wear off in time, while the benefit conferred on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
people would be extensive and permanent. From
hence they hurried on, for they were still rapid in
their motions, to Taganroy, or the “Cape of the
Teakettle,” so called from the form of the rock on
which the fortress stands; and from thence to Nakitchivan
on the Don. “This town,” says Heber, “is
a singular mixture of Cossack houses and the black
felt tents of the Kalmucs, all fishermen, and with
their habitations almost thrust into the river. From
the windows of the public-house where I am writing,
the view is very singular and pleasing. The moon
is risen, and throws a broad glare of light over the
Don, which is here so widely overflowed that the
opposite bank is scarcely visible; the foreground is
a steep limestone hill covered with cottages and circular
tents; and we hear on every side the mingled
characteristic sounds of the singing of the boatmen
on the river, the barking of the large ferocious Kalmuc
dogs, which in all these countries are suffered
to prowl about during the night, blended with the
low monotonous chant of the Cossack women, who
are enjoying the fine evening, and dancing in a large
circle in the streets.”</p>

<p>Tcherkask, their next station, which in spring was
mostly under water, seemed in some degree to resemble
Venice. It was, in the opinion of our travellers,
one of the most singular towns in the world,
where, in the season of the inundation, the communication
between one house and another was preserved
by a kind of balcony or gallery, raised on
wooden pillars, and running along the streets on
both sides. From hence they continued their journey
along the banks of the Kuban and the frontiers
of Circassia, having in view the wild range of the
Caucasus, with vast forests of oak at its roots. The
population of these districts, fierce marauding mountaineers,
beheld with regret the efforts which were
making by the Russian government to wean them
from their sanguinary habits. Their whole delight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
consisted in bloodshed and plunder. But their
frays had gradually become less and less frequent:
“Formerly,” said their guide, “we were ourselves
a terror to our neighbours&mdash;but we are now,” added
he with a sigh&mdash;“a civilized people!” “The land
on the Russian side of the river (Kuban),” says
Heber, “is but scantily wooded; on the southern
side it rises in a magnificent theatre of oak woods,
interspersed with cultivated ground, and the smoke
of villages, with the ridges of Caucasus above the
whole. The nearest hills are by no means gigantic;
but there are some white peaks which rise at a vast
distance, and which proved to us that these were
only the first story of the mountain.”</p>

<p>Our travellers now traversed the Crimea, and proceeded
across a stepp intersected by numerous
streams, inlets of the sea, and some large salt-water
lakes, to Odessa, an interesting town, which in the
opinion of Heber owed its prosperity to the administration
of the Duc de Richelieu far more than to
any natural advantages. Their route now lay across
Russian Poland, Hungary, Austria, and Northern
Germany. They arrived at Yarmouth on the 14th
of October, 1806, and Heber immediately set forward
to join the family circle at Hodnet, where he enjoyed
the satisfaction which every wanderer feels
when returning, after a long and toilsome journey, to
his native home.</p>

<p>In the year 1807 Heber took orders, and obtained
the living of Hodnet, in Shropshire, which was in
his brother’s gift; he then returned to Oxford for the
purpose of taking his degree as master of arts. It
will readily be supposed that he, whose piety was
truly apostolical, even while in a secular station,
now that he had assumed the habit of a Christian
minister, became doubly anxious to render not only
his conduct, but the very thoughts of his mind, pure
as became his holy calling. The church has in no
age been destitute of teachers remarkable for their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
virtue and benevolence; but even among preachers
of the gospel it is not often that a man so gifted as
Heber with genius, with enlarged knowledge of mankind,
with almost boundless charity and benevolence,
can be found, the perusal of whose life must create
in the reader as well as in me the vain wish that we
had numbered him among our friends. Yet Heber
was far from being an ascetic. Like all men of high
imaginative powers who have never suffered vice to
brush away the down from their nobler feelings, he
had a bold faith in the enduring nature of affection,
and spoke of love, not like a pert worldling, whom no
excellence could kindle, but like a philosopher, aware
of the prejudices of the vulgar, but far above being
swayed by them. “To speak, however, my serious
opinion,” says he, in a letter to a friend, “I believe
that were it possible for a well-founded passion to
wear out, the very recollection of it would be more
valuable than the greatest happiness afforded by
those calm and vulgar kindnesses which chiefly proceed
from knowing no great harm of one another.
You remember Shenstone’s epitaph on Miss Dolman:
<i>Vale, Maria, Puellarum Elegantissima, heu
quanto minus est cum reliquis versari quam tui meminisse.</i>
I am not sure how long that romance of passion
may continue which the world shows such
anxiety to wean us of as soon as possible, and which
it laughs at because it envies; but, end when it may,
it is never lost, but will contribute, like fermentation,
to make the remainder of the cup of happiness more
pleasant and wholesome.”</p>

<p>In the April of 1809 Heber married Amelia, youngest
daughter of Dr. Shipley, dean of St. Asaph. On
this occasion he undertook an excursion in Wales,
the beauties of which, notwithstanding the variety
of scenes he had beheld, he seemed to consider
equal to those of any country in the world. He then
settled on his rectory, and employed himself earnestly
in diffusing among his parishioners a proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
sense of religion, and habits of piety and virtue.
“He became, indeed,” says his excellent widow,
“their earthly guide, their pastor, and friend. His
ear was never shut to their complaints, nor his hands
closed to their wants. Instead of hiding his face
from the poor, he sought out distress; he made it a
rule, from which no circumstances induced him to
swerve, to ‘give to all who asked,’ however trifling
the sum; and wherever he had an opportunity, he
never failed to inquire into, and more effectually to
relieve their distress. He could not pass a sick person,
or a child crying, without endeavouring to
sooth and help them; and the kindness of his manner
always rendered his gifts doubly valuable.”</p>

<p>Heber, whose leisure, however, was not considerable,
was now led, by a praiseworthy literary ambition,
to become a contributor to the Quarterly Review,
where many of the excellent critiques on
books of travels which appeared about that period
were of his writing. Having himself travelled, he
knew how to appreciate the historian of foreign
manners, while the high tone of his Christian virtues
emancipated him from that mean jealousy with
which little minds are inspired by the success of a
rival. He was, moreover, admirably calculated by
the extent and variety of his reading, in which perhaps,
he was scarcely excelled even by Dr. Southey
or Sir Walter Scott, for determining the amount of
information which any particular observer added to
the common stock; without which no critic, however
able or acute, can possibly judge with accuracy
of the merits of a traveller. The Castalian rill,
which Providence had intrusted to our traveller’s
keeping, was not, in the mean while, permitted to
stagnate. Various poems, of different character and
pretensions, he from time to time composed, and submitted
to the world; and in 1812 published a collected
edition of all his poetical works. In the same
year he was afflicted by a severe and somewhat protracted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
illness. Indeed, he continued through life,
observes Mrs. Heber, subject to inflammatory attacks,
though rigid temperance and exercise enabled
him to pursue his studies without inconvenience.
He was an early riser, and having performed his
daily devotions, devoted the larger portion of the
day to literature; from which, nevertheless, he was
ready to separate himself at the call of duty.</p>

<p>I have before observed that Heber’s character was
by no means morose or ascetic; he was full of vivacity,
good-humour, wit, and no enemy to amusements;
but he conceived that on Sunday it was the
Christian’s duty to abstain as far as possible from
every species of business. An anecdote illustrative
of this point, which is related by Mrs. Heber, is well
worth repeating: As Mr. Reginald Heber was riding
one Sunday morning to preach at Moreton, his horse
cast a shoe. Seeing the village blacksmith standing
at the door of his forge, he requested him to replace
it. The man immediately set about blowing up the
embers of his Saturday night’s fire, on seeing which,
he said, “On second thoughts, John, it does not signify;
I can walk my mare; it will not lame her, and
I do not like to disturb your day of rest.”</p>

<p>In 1815 he was appointed Bampton lecturer. His
subject was necessarily theological, so that it is not
within my competence to decide respecting the
merit of his mode of treating it; but notwithstanding
that it excited the opposition of one antagonist,
who called in question his orthodoxy, the lectures
appear, when published, to have been generally approved
of by the clergy, the legitimate judges in
such matters. Two years after this he was promoted
to a stall in the cathedral of St. Asaph, an
appointment which led to many journeys into Wales,
during which he yielded up his mind to the delight
of poetical composition. In the midst of these and
similar enjoyments, which, to a mind so purely and
beautifully constituted as his, must have been secondary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
only to those arising from the exercise of
virtue, Heber underwent the affliction of losing at a
very early age his only child. This bereavement,
however, severely as it affected his heart, he submitted
to with that religious resignation which his
character would have led us to expect from him.</p>

<p>Our traveller himself appeared, in the spring of
1820, in extreme danger of being snatched away from
the world. By constantly attending in the chambers
of the sick, during the prevalence of putrid
sore-throat in his neighbourhood, he caught this dangerous
disorder, which from himself was communicated
to seven members of his household, to none
of whom, however, did it prove fatal. In the autumn
of the same year he paid a visit to Oxford, “when,”
says Mrs. Heber, “he had the gratification of hearing
‘Palestine’ performed as an oratorio in the same
theatre, where, seventeen years before, he had recited
it to an equally, or perhaps a more crowded
audience than was then assembled. To the eye the
scene was the same, but its component parts were
widely different. Of the relations who were present
at the former period, some had paid the debt of nature;
the greater number of his contemporaries were
scattered abroad in the pursuit of their respective
professions; new faces occupied the arena.”</p>

<p>About the close of the year 1822 Heber received,
through his friend, the Right Honourable Watkins
Williams Wynn, the offer of the bishopric of Calcutta.
Our traveller had long viewed with deep interest
the progress of Christianity in the East, and
the prospect opened to him by this offer, of contributing
by his own zeal and exertions to the success
of so holy a cause, seems quickly to have outweighed
in his mind every consideration of personal
interest, and to have determined him, at all hazards,
to accept of that distinguished but dangerous post.
The conduct of Mr. Wynn on this occasion, his ardent
desire that India should not be deprived of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
services of so good, so great a man (for virtue like
Heber’s is true greatness), while he was scarcely
less unwilling to lose, certainly for a considerable
time, if not, as it happened, for ever, a friend of incomparable
value, reflects the highest honour on his
heart and character. “The king,” said he, “has
returned his <i>entire</i> approbation of your appointment
to Calcutta, and if I could only divide you, so as to
leave one in England and send the other to India, it
would also have mine; but the die is now cast, and
we must not look on any side but that which stands
uppermost.” To this Heber replied, “For this last,
as well as for all former proofs of your kindness, accept
my best thanks. God grant that my conduct
in India may be such as not to do your recommendation
discredit, or make you repent the flattering
confidence which you have placed in me.”</p>

<p>When Heber’s intention of leaving England was
made known, he received from every quarter those
warm voluntary testimonies of affection and regret
which nothing but virtue, distinguished, persevering,
exalted, can command. His own parishioners, as
was natural, were the foremost in their demonstrations
of their profound esteem. Rich, poor, old, and
young&mdash;all joined in presenting their exemplary pastor
with a lasting mark of the veneration in which
his character was held among them. “Almost the
last business,” says Mrs. Heber, “which Dr. Heber
(he had recently been created D.D. by the University
of Oxford) transacted before he left Shropshire was
settling a long-standing account, in which he had
been charged as debtor to the amount of a hundred
pounds; but it was believed by those who were best
acquainted with the circumstances, that he was not
bound either in law or probity to pay it. As he himself,
however, did not feel certain on this point, he
resolved to pay the money, observing to a friend who
endeavoured to dissuade him, ‘How can I reasonably
hope for a blessing on my undertaking, or how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
can I commence so long a voyage with a quiet conscience,
if I leave even the shadow of a committed
act of injustice behind?’ About the same time an
unknown person sent him a small sum of money
through the hands of a clergyman in Shrewsbury,
confessing that he had defrauded him of it, and stating
that he could not endure to see him leave England
for such objects without relieving his own
conscience by making restitution. On the 22d of
April, 1823,” she continues, “Dr. Heber finally took
leave of Shropshire: from a range of high grounds
near Newport, he turned back to catch a last view
of his beloved Hodnet; and here the feelings which
he had hitherto suppressed in tenderness to others
burst forth unrestrained, and he uttered the words
which have proved prophetic, that he ‘should return
to it no more!’”</p>

<p>Heber, having made all necessary preparations for
his long voyage, and received consecration, repaired
on the 16th of June on board the Company’s ship
Grenville, in which he and his family were to proceed
to India. As our traveller’s first desire, in
whatever position he happened to be placed, was to
effect all the good in his power, he no sooner found
himself on board than he endeavoured to communicate
to the sailors a sense of their religious duties;
which he did with all that authority and effect which
genius and virtue invariably exert over inferior individuals.
His exhortations were listened to attentively
and respectfully; and there can be no doubt
produced, in many instances at least, conviction and
amendment of life. The influence which the majestic
simplicity of his character enabled him to exercise
over his rude audience may in some measure
be conceived from the following anecdote: “We
had divine service on deck this morning,” says he;
“a large shoal of dolphins were playing round the
ship, and I thought it right to interfere to check the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
harpoons and fishing-hooks of some of the crew. I
am not strict in my notions of what is called the
Christian Sabbath; but the wanton destruction of
animal life seems to be precisely one of those works
by which the sanctity and charity of our weekly
feast would be profaned. The sailors took my reproof
in good part.” Such were his occupations
until, on the 3d of October, the ship safely anchored
in Sangor roads, in the Hoogly, or great western
branch of the Ganges.</p>

<p>Heber was now arrived in the most extraordinary
region, Greece and Egypt perhaps excepted, which
has ever been inhabited by mankind. And he was
well calculated by his high enthusiasm, extensive
learning, and remarkable freedom from prejudice, to
conceive all the splendour of the scene before him,
to enter profoundly into the spirit of its institutions,
and to describe with graceful and simple eloquence
the picturesque variety of manners which the natives
of this vast empire present to the contemplation
of a stranger. “Two observations struck me
forcibly,” says he; “first, that the deep bronze tint
(observable in the Hindoos) is more naturally agreeable
to the human eye than the fair skins of Europe,
since we are not displeased with it even in the first
instance, while it is well known that to them a fair
complexion gives the idea of ill health, and of that
sort of deformity which in our eyes belongs to an
Albino. There is, indeed, something in a negro
which requires long habit to reconcile the eye to
him; but for this the features and the hair, far more
than the colour, are answerable. The second observation
was, how entirely the idea of indelicacy,
which would naturally belong to such naked figures
as those now around us, if they were white, is prevented
by their being of a different colour from ourselves.
So much are we children of association and
habit, and so instinctively and immediately do our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
feelings adapt themselves to a total change of circumstances!
It is the partial and inconsistent change
only which affects us.”</p>

<p>They now entered the mighty Ganges, and sailing
up towards Calcutta through the Sunderbunds, or
rather along their western limit, beheld their dark
impenetrable forests stretching away interminably
towards the right, while a rich vegetable fragrance
was wafted from the shore. The current of the
river, when increased by the ebb-tide, was found as
they ascended to be tremendously rapid, running at
no less a rate, according to their pilot, than ten or
eleven miles an hour. On arriving at Calcutta,
Heber found that the ecclesiastical business of his
bishopric, at all times multiplex and extensive, had
now, since the death of Dr. Middleton, accumulated
prodigiously; so that, although he had come out
neither with the expectation nor the wish to find his
place a sinecure, he felt somewhat alarmed at the
laborious prospect before him. However, he was
a man accustomed to labour, and not easily discouraged.
He therefore diligently applied himself to
business, and had soon the satisfaction to find that,
notwithstanding the formidable appearance of things
on his first arrival, it was still possible, after fully
performing his duty, which no consideration could
induce him to neglect, to command sufficient leisure
for studying whatever was curious or striking in the
natural or moral aspect of Hindostan. Former travellers,
he now found, were, notwithstanding their
numbers, very far from having exhausted the subject,
either because the phenomena of Asiatic manners
are, like those of the heavens, in a state of perpetual
change, or because these, continuing the same, which
however they do not, appear under various phases
to different men, from being viewed by each individual
from the peculiar point of observation afforded
by his character and acquirements.</p>

<p>In the course of seven months, Heber had achieved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
that portion of his task which was to be performed
in the capital. Next to this in importance was his
visitation through the Upper Provinces, an expedition
in which he had hoped to be accompanied by his
family; but this being rendered impracticable by the
delicate health of his wife, and the tender age of his
infant child, he departed with his domestic chaplain,
Mr. Stowe, in a sixteen-oared pinnace, for Dacca.
The shores of the Ganges, though flat almost throughout
Bengal, are far from wanting in stately or picturesque
objects. Lofty pagodas, with their fantastic
angular domes, towering over forests of bamboos,
banyans, and cocoa-trees; ruins of Mussulman palaces;
wild tracts of jungle inhabited by tigers; groves
of peepul or tamarind-trees; with Hindoo villages or
hamlets, perched upon artificial mounds to escape the
periodical inundations of the river. But no scene
is possessed of all advantages. There is always
some small drawback, to afford man an excuse for
enjoying the delicious pleasure of complaining.
“One of the greatest plagues we have yet met with
in this journey,” says Heber, “is that of the winged
bugs. In shape, size, and scent, with the additional
faculty of flying, they resemble the ‘grabbatic’
genus, too well known in England. The night of
our lying off Barrackpoor, they were troublesome;
but when we were off the rajah’s palace, they came
out, like the ghosts of his ancestor’s armies, in hundreds
and thousands from every bush and every
heap of ruins, and so filled our cabins as to make
them barely endurable. These unhappy animals
crowded round our candles in such swarms, some
just burning their feet and wings on the edge of the
glass shade, and thus toppling over, others, more
bold, flying right into the crater, and meeting their
death there, that we really paid no attention to what
was next day a ghastly spectacle,&mdash;the mighty army
which had settled on the wet paint of the ceiling,
and remained there, black and stinking, till the ants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
devoured them. These last swarm in my pinnace:
they have eaten up no inconsiderable portion of my
provisions, and have taken, I trust to their benefit, a
whole box of blue pills; but as they do their best to
clear it of all other vermin, I cannot but look upon
them with some degree of favour.”</p>

<p>A gentleman travelling as Heber travelled in
India is likely to meet with few personal adventures.
He runs no risk, except from the climate, and moves
on smoothly from one station to another, in that
state of tranquillity which is useful, if not necessary,
to calm, dispassionate observation. Thus our
traveller sailed from Calcutta to Dacca, once renowned
for the spaciousness and splendour of its
palaces, but now ruined, deserted, and reduced to be
the haunt of bats, serpents, and every loathsome
thing. Here, in an interview with the nawâb, who,
like his imperial master of Delhi, has long been reduced
to subsist upon the bounty of the Company,
Heber exhibited that delicate regard for the feelings
of a man,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fallen from his high estate,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which a careful observation of his previous life
would have led us to expect from him. Here he
had the misfortune to lose Mr. Stowe, his domestic
chaplain, who, by his many excellent and amiable
qualities, had long occupied the place of a friend in
his affections.</p>

<p>From Dacca, where his stay was much longer
than he had anticipated, he proceeded up the river.
Furreedpoor, his next station, did not long detain
him. Near Rajmahal he approached, but did not
visit, the ruins of Gour, an ancient city, which
almost rivalled Babylon or Nineveh in extent, and
which fell to decay, because the Ganges, which once
flowed under its walls, changed its bed, and took
another direction, six or seven miles south of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
city. However, on arriving next day at the town
of Rajmahal, to make up in some measure for this
loss, he undertook a short excursion to the ruined
palace of Sultan Sujah, brother of Araungzêbe. “I
was a little at a loss,” says he, “to find my way
through the ruins and young jungle, when a man
came up, and in Persian, with many low bows, offered
his services. He led me into a sort of second
court, a little lower on the hill, where I saw two
European tombs, and then to three very beautiful
arches of black slate, on pillars of the same, leading
into a small but singularly elegant hall, opening immediately
on the river, though a considerable height
above it, through similar arches to those by which
we entered. The roof was vaulted with stone, delicately
carved, and the walls divided by Gothic tracery
into panels, still retaining traces of gilding and
Arabic inscriptions. At each end of this beautiful
room was a Gothic arch, in like manner of slate,
leading into two small square apartments, ornamented
in the same way, and also opening on the river.
The centre room might be thirty feet long, each of
the others fifteen square. For their size I cannot conceive
more delightful apartments. The view was
very fine. The river, as if incensed at having been
obliged to make a circuit round the barrier of the
hills, and impeded here again by the rocks under the
castle, sweeps round this corner with exceeding
violence, roaring and foaming like a gigantic Dee.
The range of hills runs to the left-hand, beautiful,
blue, and woody.”</p>

<p>From thence he proceeded, as before, up the
Ganges, observing whatever was remarkable, making
a short stay at each of the European stations on his
way, for the purpose of preaching or baptizing, and
arrived on the 20th of August at Patna. At this
city, which is extensive, and situated in a commanding
position, he remained several days, for the purpose
of preaching and administering confirmation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
He then continued his voyage to Ghazeepoor, famous
for its rose-gardens and salubrious air. “The rose-fields,
which occupy many hundred acres in the
neighbourhood, are described as, at the proper
season, extremely beautiful. They are cultivated
for distillation, and for making ‘attar.’ Rose-water
is both good and cheap here. The price of a seer,
or weight of two pounds (a large quart), of the best,
being eight anas, or a shilling. The attar is obtained
after the rose-water is made, by setting it out
during the night and till sunrise in the morning, in
large open vessels exposed to the air, and then skimming
off the essential oil which floats at the top.”
“To produce one rupee’s weight of attar, two hundred
thousand well-grown roses are required.” This
small quantity, when warranted genuine, for they
begin to adulterate it on the spot, costs one hundred
sicca rupees, or ten pounds sterling.</p>

<p>A short way farther up the stream, Heber quitted
his pinnace, and providing himself with bearers, continued
his journey to Benares by land. Of Benares
I have already given a brief description in the Life
of Bernier. Heber’s stay in it was short. He
visited with attention its principal curiosities, and
conversed on several points with some of its Brahminical
professors, whose belief in Hindooism he
regarded as very equivocal. He then continued his
voyage up the river to Allahabad, where he dismissed
his pinnace, and made the necessary preparations
for performing the remainder of his journey by land.
Archdeacon Corrie, who had accompanied him from
Calcutta, and Mr. Lushington, whom he joined on
the way, were now his travelling companions, and
with their attendants helped to increase his motley
caravan, which consisted of twenty-four camels, eight
carts drawn by bullocks, twenty-four horse-servants,
ten ponies, forty bearers, and coolies of different
descriptions, twelve tent-pitchers, and a guard of
twenty sepoys under a native officer. With this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
retinue, which in the eyes of a European would
have had something of a princely air, Heber proceeded
by the way of Cawnpoor to Lucknow, the
capital of the kingdom of Oude, where he enjoyed
the honour of breakfasting with the monarch of this
ill-governed state, who, on this occasion at least,
appeared desirous of imitating the manners of the
English.</p>

<p>At Lucknow Heber separated from his companions;
and, accompanied merely by his attendants,
directed his course towards the wild districts at the
foot of the Himalaya. On arriving at Barelly, not
more than fifty miles distant from the nearest range,
he vainly looked out for the snowy peaks of this
“monarch of mountains;” but, instead, discovered
nothing but a ridge of black clouds, and a gray autumnal
haze through which no object was discernible.
The features of the country now became wild and
striking. Forests infested by malaria, tigers, and
lions, and half-desolate plains, announced the termination
of the fertile provinces of Hindostan, and
the approach to a different region. Here “we had,”
says Heber, “a first view of the range of the Himalaya,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
indistinctly seen through the haze, but not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
so indistinctly as to conceal the general form of the
mountains. The nearer hills are blue, and in outline
and tints resemble pretty closely, at this distance,
those which close in the vale of Clwyd.
Above these rose what might, in the present unfavourable
atmosphere, have been taken for clouds,
had not their seat been so stationary, and their outline
so harsh and pyramidical&mdash;the patriarchs of the
continent, perhaps the surviving ruins of a former
world, white and glistening as alabaster, and even at
this distance, of probably one hundred and fifty
miles, towering above the nearer and secondary
range, as much as those last (though said to be
seven thousand six hundred feet high) are above the
plain in which we were standing. I felt intense
delight and awe in looking on them, but the pleasure
lasted not many minutes; the clouds closed in again,
as on the fairy castle of St. John, and left us but
the former gray cold horizon, girding in the green
plain of Rohiland, and broken only by people and
mango-trees.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a>
The Himalaya mountains have been said, by some other travellers,
to be visible, in clear weather, from Patna, a distance of two hundred
miles. The fact appears to be by no means improbable. From the
window of the library in which these pages are written, the snowy
mountains of Switzerland and Savoy&mdash;Mont Blanc, the Great and Little
St. Bernard, and the peaks of St. Corvin and St. Gothard&mdash;are almost
constantly visible during the prevalence of the south-west wind. From
the appearance of these mountains a tolerable idea may be formed of the
aspect of the Himalaya. During summer thin vapours commonly
obstruct the view, except in the early dawn; and if, as sometimes happens,
the white peaks appear in the afternoon, when the sun’s rays are
streaming upon them from the west, they are generally, by the unpractised
observer, mistaken for clouds. But in the cool autumnal mornings
just before the sun rises above the horizon, Mont Blanc, though one
hundred and twenty-five miles distant, is painted with astonishing distinctness
upon the sky, and towering above the sea of white vapour which
overspreads the great plain of Burgundy and rises almost to the summit
of the Jura, seems but a few leagues distant. A little before sunset it
presents a totally different aspect. Instead of the dusky mass which
we beheld in the morning, we discover the “monarch of mountains”
clothed in dazzling white, rising far above every surrounding object;
while the glittering pinnacles of the inferior mountains seem to stretch
away interminably to the right and left, until their peaks are confounded
and lost in the dimness of the horizon. The Mont St. Gothard, which
is very distinctly visible, at least during clear weather, is distant one
hundred and seventy miles from the point of observation. With respect
to Mont Blanc, its whole aspect, when viewed through a good telescope,
is so admirably defined, that every inequality in its surface is clearly
discernible, so that an excellent sketch of it might be taken from my
library. The dark chain of the Jura, which conceals its base, and
stretches from Geneva almost to the Rhine, increases by contrast the
magnificence of the view, which, for extent and grandeur, falls very
little short, perhaps, of any landscape in Europe.</p>

</div>

<p>Next day, soon after sunrise, he saw distinctly,
painted on a clear blue sky, the prodigiously lofty
pinnacles of these mountains, the centre of earth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Its altar, and its cradle, and its throne,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which, as he justly observes, “are really among the
greatest earthly works of the Almighty Creator’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
hands&mdash;the highest spots below the moon&mdash;and
overtopping by many hundred feet the summits
of Cotopaxi and Chimborazo.” To approach these
mountains, however, from the south, the traveller
has to traverse a belt of forest and jungle, where
the air is impregnated with the most deadly qualities.
“I asked Mr. Boulderson if it were true,” says
Heber, “that the monkeys forsook these woods
during the unwholesome months. He answered
that not the monkeys only, but every thing which
has the breath of life instinctively deserts them, from
the beginning of April to October. The tigers go up
to the hills, the antelopes and wild hogs make incursions
into the cultivated plain; and those persons,
such as dâkbearers, or military officers who
are obliged to traverse the forests in the intervening
months, agree that not so much as a bird can be
heard or seen in the frightful solitude.” Yet the
insalubrity of these districts is not of any ancient
date. Thirty years ago, though fever and ague
were common, the plains were populous and productive,
and considerable progress was made in reclaiming
the forest; but the devastation consequent
upon the invasion of Meer Khan, in 1805, checked
the course of population, which has never since been
able to recover itself.</p>

<p>Through this deadly region Heber passed with all
possible rapidity, though the majestic trees which
bordered the road, the songs of the birds in their
branches (for it was now November), and the luxuriant
vegetation which on all sides covered the
soil, conferred a kind of syren beauty upon the scene,
which tempted the wayfarer to a fatal pause. At
length, after a long, fatiguing march, they found
themselves upon rising ground, at the entrance to a
green valley, with woody mountains on either side,
and a considerable river running through it, dashing
over a rocky bottom, with great noise and violence.
The scenery now put on features of surpassing beauty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
Mountains, precipices, narrow romantic dells; with
rivers which were sometimes seen, and sometimes
only heard rolling at the bottom of them; trees inhabited
by innumerable white monkeys and singing
birds, and copses abounding in black and purple
pheasants. When they had climbed up to a considerable
height upon the lower range of the mountains,
there burst suddenly upon their sight the most awfully
magnificent spectacle which the earth furnishes
for the contemplation of man. Language always
fails to convey an adequate conception of the tumultuous
delight experienced in such positions. The
mind, wrought upon by history, by poetry, by a secret
hungering after the sublime, instantaneously feels
itself in the presence of objects which, by their prodigious
magnitude and elevation, enhanced by an
idea of their unapproachableness, seem for a moment
to surpass the most ambitious aspirations of the
imagination, and in reality carry our thoughts</p>

<p>Our traveller, standing on the platform from whence
the Indian Caucasus can be most advantageously
contemplated, beheld a range of snow-white pinnacles,
which, stretching like an interminable line
of shining spears from east to west, appeared with
their glittering points to pierce the deep blue sky,
which formed the ground of this landscape of unrivalled
glory and splendour. At the foot of these
mountains stands Almorah, the last point of Heber’s
journey in this direction; whence, after a short
stay, he again descended to the plain, and pursued
his route to Meerut, and thence to Delhi.</p>

<p>The imperial city, the ruins of which extend over
a surface as large as London, is still the residence
of the descendants of the Mogul sovereigns of India.
The reader who remembers how superb it was when
visited by Bernier will learn with a melancholy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
regret that all its grandeur and power have departed
from it, leaving in their stead want, wretchedness,
decay, and disease. Heber was presented to the
poor old man who, as the descendant of Akbar, is
still, as it were in mockery, denominated “Emperor
of Delhi.” Those who delight to triumph over
fallen greatness may purchase this pleasure by a
journey to Delhi; for myself, much as I abhor a
tyrant, few remote scenes of distress, unless such
in which whole nations are sufferers, could touch
me more sensibly than the misfortunes of this Mogul
prince, and I exclaim, with the prophet, “How are
the mighty fallen!” It is true they deserved their
fate&mdash;history in their, as in all other cases, justifies
the ways of Providence&mdash;but we therefore pity them
the more; and, before we lift up our hand to cast a
stone at them, our heart involuntarily forms the
earnest wish that we may by our justice and equity
deserve the diadem which we have wrested from
their brows. This consideration is the only thing
which can confer an interest on such a presentation.
In every other point of view it is, like every thing
of the kind, a vulgar show, which has no more
meaning than a theatrical exhibition.</p>

<p>From Delhi Heber proceeded to the still more ancient
capital of Agra, where the principal objects of
curiosity “are the Motee Musjeed, a beautiful mosque
of white marble, carved with exquisite simplicity
and elegance; and the palace built by Akbar, in a
great degree of the same material, and containing
some noble rooms, now sadly disfigured and destroyed
by neglect, and by being used as warehouses, armories,
offices, and lodging-rooms for the garrison.
The hall, now used as the ‘Dewanny Aum,’ or public
court of justice, is a splendid edifice, supported by
pillars and arches of white marble, as large and more
nobly simple than that of Delhi. The ornaments,
carving, and mosaic of the smaller apartments, in
which was formerly the Zenanah, are equal or superior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
to any thing which is described as found in the
Alhambra. The view from those rooms is very fine,
at the same time that there are some, adapted for the
hot winds, from which light is carefully excluded.
This suite is lined with small mirrors in fantastic
frames; a cascade of water, also surrounded by
mirrors, has been made to gush from a recess at the
upper end, and marble channels, beautifully inlaid
with cornelians, agates, and jasper, convey the
stream to every side of the apartment.” Heber
likewise visited the Taj-mahal, which I have described
in the Life of Bernier, and observes, that after
hearing its praises ever since he had been in India,
its beauty rather exceeded than fell short of his expectations.
After holding a confirmation, at which
about forty persons were made full members of the
Christian church, our traveller departed from Agra,
and commenced his journey across the independent
states of Western India. During this portion of his
travels he obtained, from unexceptionable authority,
an account of the gorgeous style in which that fortunate
adventurer, Sir David Ochterlony, lived in
Central India. “Dr. Smith,” he observes, “in his
late march from Mhow to Meerut, passed by Sir
David’s camp. The ‘barra sahib,’ or great man,
was merely travelling with his own family and personal
followers from Delhi to Jyepoor, but his retinue,
including servants, escort, European and native
aids-de-camp, and the various nondescripts of an
Asiatic train, together with the apparatus of horses,
elephants, and camels&mdash;the number of his tents, and
the size of the enclosure, hung round with red cloth,
by which his own and his daughter’s private tents
were fenced in from the eyes of the profane, were
what a European, or even an old Indian whose experience
had been confined to Bengal, would scarcely
be brought to credit.”</p>

<p>Our traveller’s journey through Rajpootana was
attended by circumstances flattering to his personal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
feelings. The petty sovereigns through whose dominions
his route lay invariably received him hospitably
when he visited their capitals, and on some
occasions, when he did not choose to diverge so far
from the road, sent messengers expressly to meet
him on the way with polite invitations to their court.
He pushed on, however, with considerable expedition,
and having traversed the territories, and beheld
the capitals of Jyepoor, Ajmere, Bunaira, and others,
proceeded, by way of Neemuch and Baroda, to
Bombay. His time, during his stay in this city, was
principally occupied with ecclesiastical business, in
promoting the founding of schools, and in conversing
with that venerable statesman and traveller, Mr.
Elphinstone, the governor, who, from the most humane
and enlightened motives, has endeavoured,
with success, to diffuse among the natives a knowledge
of our literature and sciences. Here Heber
had the satisfaction of being joined by his wife and
elder child. With these, shortly afterward, he visited
the cavern temples of Elephanta and Kennery;
and subsequently, in company with Archdeacon
Barnes, made an excursion across the Western
Ghants to Poonah, in the Deccan, during which he
enjoyed an opportunity of examining another celebrated
cavern temple at Carlee. I cannot refuse
myself the pleasure, or deprive the reader of the
advantage, of inserting in this place the character
which Heber has drawn of the most extraordinary
man whom he encountered during his travels. “Mr.
Elphinstone,” says he, “is in every respect an extraordinary
man, possessing great activity of body
and mind; remarkable talent for and application to
public business; a love of literature, and a degree
of almost universal information, such as I have met
with in no other person similarly situated, and manners
and conversation of the most amiable and interesting
character. While he has seen more of
India and the adjoining countries than any man now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
living, and has been engaged in active political and
sometimes military duties since the age of eighteen,
he has found time, not only to cultivate the languages
of Hindostan and Persia, but to preserve and extend
his acquaintance with the Greek and Latin
classics, with the French and Italian, with all the
elder and more distinguished English writers, and
with the current and popular literature of the day,
both in poetry, history, politics, and political economy.
With these remarkable accomplishments,
and notwithstanding a temperance amounting to
rigid abstinence, he is fond of society; and it is a
common subject of surprise with his friends, at what
hour of the day or night he found time for the acquisition
of knowledge. His policy, so far as India is
concerned, appeared to me peculiarly wise and
liberal, and he is evidently attached to, and thinks
well of, the country and its inhabitants. His public
measures, in their general tendency, evince a steady
wish to improve their present condition. No government
in India pays so much attention to schools
and public institutions for education. In none are
the taxes lighter; and in the administration of justice
to the natives in their own languages, in the
establishment of punchacts, in the degree in which
he employs the natives in official situations, and the
countenance and familiarity which he extends to all
the natives of rank who approach him, he seems to
have reduced to practice almost all the reforms which
had struck me as most required in the system of
government pursued in those provinces of our eastern
empire which I had previously visited.”</p>

<p>From Bombay, Heber sailed with his wife and
daughter to Ceylon, a large portion of which he visited.
He then proceeded to Calcutta. On the 30th
of January, 1826, shortly after his recovery from a
fever, he again quitted his family for the purpose of
visiting Madras and the southern provinces of India.
At Madras he was received with great kindness by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
Sir Thomas Munro, who was warmly desirous of
rendering his position as little disagreeable as the
season and climate would permit. From thence he
proceeded through Caddalore and Tanjore to Trichinopoly,
where, on the 3d of April, 1826, his pious,
active, and valuable life was closed. “It were a
useless,” says Mrs. Heber, “and a deeply painful
task to enter into any detail of the apparent cause
of his death: it is sufficient to say that disease had,
unsuspected, been existing for some time; and that
it was the opinion of all the medical men in attendance,
that under no circumstances could his invaluable
life have been very long preserved, though the
event was undoubtedly hastened by the effects of
climate, by intense mental application to those duties
which increased in interest with every step he took,
and was finally caused by the effects of cold on a
frame exhausted by heat and fatigue.” His mortal
remains were attended to the grave with the highest
honours, and followed by the tears of the inhabitants
of Trichinopoly. They rest on the north side of the
altar in St. John’s Church.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
